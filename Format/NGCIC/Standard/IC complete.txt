Carl Frederick Pechüle discovered IC 4 on 12 Sep 1893 with an 11" refractor at the Copenhagen observatory, probably while searching for a comet.  He reported "very faint, pretty round, 10"-12" diameter, perhaps even bigger, fairly even brightness."  The IC position is 3' too far south, but there are no other nearby candidates.

24" (9/1/16): at 220x; fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, round, 20" diameter, gradually increases to the center.  Situated between two mag 12.5 stars 3.4' NW and 4.0' SE.  Forms a pair (identical redshifts) with IC 8 3.8' NE.

MCG -01-01-074, located 8.2' SSW, appeared extremely faint, very small, occasionally elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, very low surface brightness.

Truman Safford discovered IC 6 = Sf. 89 = J. I-4 on 23 Sep 1867 with the 18.5-inch refractor at the Dearborn Observatory.  His position is 1' SE of PGC 1228, the brighter of a pair with IC 8, which he missed.  The Dearborn discovery list was not published until 1887 and added as an appendix to the NGC the following year.  Stephane Javelle probably was unaware of the prior discovery, and found the galaxy again on 19 Sep 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory. He reported it as the 4th object in his first discovery list with description "faint, round, 15" diameter, stellar nucleus of 14th mag."  Dreyer assumed Sf. 89 referred to nearby IC 8 so Javelle was credited with the discovery of IC 6.

18" (9/6/10): this local group dwarf Irregular was immediately picked up at 108x (without a printed finder chart) as a large, low surface brightness hazy glow, ~4'x2.5', roughly elongated NW-SE, though the outer extent increased with averted vision and careful viewing.  A mag 12.7 star is superposed to the southeast of center and a few stars are on the northwest end.  The 1.5' region surrounding the mag 12.7 star is the brightest portion of the galaxy and the W and NW regions have a very low surface brightness and appeared irregular and patchy.  Located 12' NE of mag 7.3 HD 486 and just north of a right triangle of mag 10-11 stars

Using 175x, a very small 15" knot was clearly visible about 50" following the mag 12.7 star.  This knot is a giant HII region (site of violent starburst formation) catalogued by Hodge and Lee (1990) as HL 111.  At 285x with direct vision a faint star at its west edge was similar in visibility, but with averted vision the HII knot was more evident.  I probably viewed the brightest component 111c, which has a diameter of 11", of this HII complex.  Two mag 10.5 stars 3.5' S and 5.5' S of the galaxy (part of the right triangle mentioned above) provide a useful guide to?pinpoint the location of HL 111.  The HII region is directly on a line and equally spaced with these stars -- just follow the stars to the small knot.

18" (7/15/07): at 225x this Local Group member (M31 subgroup) appeared faint, fairly large, slightly elongated NW-SE, ~4.5'x3.5', low even surface brightness except fades at the edges.  A mag 13 star is superimposed west of center and a fainter star follows.  Located 1.4 degrees ENE of mag 2.3 Beta Cas (Caph).

18" (10/8/05): picked up fairly easily at 115x as a large, low surface brightness hazy region with a mag 13 star superimposed.  Good view at 160x using the Meade 14mm Ultrawide.  Appeared faint, large, slightly elongated, ~4'-5' diameter (though no distinct borders) with a patchy, mottled appearance, very weak concentration.  Several faint stars (besides the mag 13 star) are superimposed.  Situated within a rich star field and appears similar to a low surface brightness emission or reflection nebula.

13.1" (11/5/83): very faint, moderately large, elongated NW-SE.  Unusually low even surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is superimposed near the center.  Located in a very rich star field just 3.3° from the galactic plane!  Member of the Local Group.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 10 = Sw VII-1 on 8 Oct 1887 and recorded "F * involved in vL, eeeF nebulosity, eee difficult.  In line with 2 stars of equal mag which with a 3rd forms a right angled triangle."

Nicholas Mayall first recognized IC 10 as a galaxy in 1935 ("An Extragalactic Object 3° from the Plane of the Galaxy" in PASP, 47, 317).  In 1936, Hubble suggested it might be a member of the local group and called it "One of the most curious objects in the sky" in his 1936 classic "The Realm of the Nebulae."  This wasn't confirmed until 1996 using Cepheid variables and the current distance estimate is ~2.5 million l.y.  This irregular dwarf galaxy is probably a member of the M31 satellite system and it lies only 3.3 deg from the galactic plane.

E.E. Barnard found IC 11 around 1892 using the 6-inch Cooke refractor at Vanderbilt Observatory in Nashville.  The discovery was probably relayed directly to Dreyer as its not mentioned in any of his published papers.  There is nothing at the IC position but Corwin notes that his description points to NGC 281, which is 30 minutes of RA east, and perhaps there was a transcription error.

The northern tidal tail was visible as a very faint, narrow extension, ~1' long, to the north-northeast (PA 30°).  The spike stretched roughly twice the length of the galaxy and was slightly brighter or easier to view near where it emerged on the north side of the galaxy.

Stephane Javelle found IC 26 = J. 1-18, along with IC 27 and 28, on 4 Nov 1891.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by Francis Leavenworth on 2 Oct 1886 and reported in list I-5 (later NGC 135).  His rough position, though, is ~2 minutes too far west, but the identification is secure based on his sketch.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position for NGC 135 around 1899 (repeated in the IC 2 notes) though Dreyer failed to equate NGC 135 and IC 26.  So, IC 26 is likely an duplicate entry for NGC 135 (or vice versa).  See NGC 135 for more.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 48 on 30 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory and noted "pB, S, R, gbM to stellar nucleus 13m."  His position (published in AN 3097) is accurate, but Dreyer made an error precessing the declination and the IC declination is 18' too far south.  Barnard apparently later sent the discovery directly to Dreyer and it was recatalogued as IC 1577, though the RA is 1 minute too small!  So, IC 48 = IC 1577, probably both from the same observation.

Barnard thought IC 48 and IC 356 were variable nebulae ("Two Probably Variable Nebulae" in AN 3097, 1892) and wrote "On November 30, 1888 I discovered a small pretty bright nebula in Cetus [IC 48] and was surprised from the brightness of the nebula, to find that it was not in any catalogue.  I carefully measured its position with the micrometer, and examined it the next night, suspecting it to be a comet.  No motion being detected it was observed further.  I have a very distinct recollection of the object and from my description I would estimate that it was between 9th and 10th magnitude.  In its center was a very small stellar nucleus of the 13th mag.  Not having seen the nebula in my subsequent sweeps in that neighborhood, I was led in 1891 to examine its position with the 12-inch.  The nebula was found with some difficulty.  It was extremely faint, and was only identified by the aid of the comparison star of the previous observation.  This was November 22, 1891.  I estimated it to be 13.5 magnitude, 1/2' in diameter, with perhaps a faint nucleus.

Roberts photographed the Gamma Cas area earlier on 17 Jan 1890, but his image shows no nebulosity and he fails to mention nebulosity in the field.

Size 10'x3'

18" (7/15/07): unusual triangular or wedge-shaped nebula just 20' NE of Gamma Cas.  At 115x appears fairly large, elongated SW-NE, ~6' diameter, with the brighter vertex at the west end. The southern edge, which extends towards the SW, is slightly brighter and more sharply defined.  The interior of the wedge is slightly fainter with subtle brightness variations.  The OIII and UHC filter dimmed the object.  IC 63 is brighter than IC 59, which is found 20' N of Gamma.

17.5" (11/1/86): distinct fan-shaped nebulosity extending east and NE with the vertex at the west end.  The southern border (extending E-W) has a sharper edge.  Brighter than nearby IC 59 in the field 20' NW.  Located 20' NE of Gamma Cassiopeiae. 

13": very faint, fairly large, very diffuse, fan-shaped.  Forms a pair with IC 63.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 89 = J 1-49 on 20 Aug 1892.  His position matches CGCG 411-016 = PGC 4578.  This galaxy is possibly identical to NGC 446, discovered by Marth on 23 Oct 1864.  Marth's position is 1.0 minute of RA west of IC 89.  UGC, CGCG, MCG and RC3 use IC 89 as the primary designation for this galaxy.  Karl Reinmuth also makes the equivalence NGC 446 = IC 89 and gives the IC position.  UGC, CGCG (411-010) and RNGC identify UGC 794 = PGC 4494 as NGC 446.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 92 = Big. 115 on 2 Nov 1885 with the 12" refractor at Paris.  His position is a fairly close match with CGCG 502-029 = PGC 4780.  This galaxy has been assumed identical to NGC 468 = h98, discovered by John Herschel on 22 Nov 1827.  Herschel's position was 4' south of the galaxy and as a result Dreyer added the comment in the IC "? different from h 98", indicating his uncertainty if IC 92 was the same object.

In March 2015, Harold Corwin checked JH's observing logs (in response to an inquiry from Courtney Seligman about the identity), and found that Herschel made an error in reducing the position of NGC 468 by 37 seconds (recording the wrong wire).  Once corrected, his position for h98 = NGC 468 is a close match with NGC 472 = UGC 870, a significantly brighter galaxy than IC 92.  So, IC 92 should be the single identity for this galaxy.

He found this galaxy again on 18 Dec 1895 and included it in list XI-18.  His position, though, was poor (30 seconds of time too large and 2.3' too far south), so Dreyer assumed Sw XI-18 was a new object and recatalogued it as IC 1671.

But Safford's position is also 4.6' SW of IC 1672, so his object could be to either object.  Malcolm Thomson and Courtney Seligman favor IC 96 = IC 1672 as Safford only found one object and IC 1672 is roughly a magnitude brighter.  Also his description is a better match with IC 1672, which is not noticeably elongated and has a brighter nucleus.

The NGC position (supposedly an improved micrometric position from C.H.F. Peters) is 0.3 minutes of RA too far east, so Dreyer mistakenly assumed Big. 117 was a new object and catalogued it again as IC 97.   So, IC 97 = NGC 475, with discovery credit to Marth.

But, according to Harold Corwin this compact HII region was assumed to be a mag 13.5 star by Bigourdan and IC 131 refers to two very small star clouds close following (seen in the 10/25/97 observation below, but missed this time). The nearly stellar knot I observed is catalogued as BCLMP 290B.

A mag 14 star is nearby and at first I thought this star was IC 131 (on the DSS this 14th magnitude "star" is a compact HII region and was also described as a star by Bigourdan).  Collinear with IC 133 8' N and IC 132 11.5' N.

Harold Corwin notes that Bigourdan made an error with the "estimated offset from M33's nucleus of his comparison star".  It also appears that his offsets were applied with the wrong signs as the relative positions of these objects are reversed in RA as well as declination!  As a result, the IC positions for IC 135, 136, 139, and 140 are incorrect and out of RA order.  But if the relative differences in RA and NPD are reversed and applied to IC 135 at the position given here, then they land on the correct positions for IC 136, 139 and 140.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 146 = J 1-70 on 30 Sep 1892.  His position matches ESO 543-006 = PGC 6083.

Leavenworth's rough position for J. 1-70 (later IC 146) is 1.6 min of RA east of this galaxy, a typical error.  Because of the poor position, Bigourdan was unable to recover the galaxy and Javelle assume his observation was new.  Herbert Howe reobserved and measured an accurate position for NGC 648 around 1900 (repeated in the IC 2 notes), though neither Howe nor Dreyer noticed the equivalence NGC 648 = IC 146.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 153 = Sw. X-9, along with IC 157, on 25 Sep 1890 and reported "eF, pS, R, sp of 2 [with IC 157]."

In 2017, I noticed that exactly 4 minutes of RA east of Swift's position is UGC 1260 (dec matches within 1') and 17' NE of this galaxy is UGC 1274.  Is this pair IC 153 and 157?  Swift's descriptions in this case are not very helpful, but regarding IC 157 he states: "D * and wide D p, nf of 2."  Do these comments apply to UGC 1274?  About 8' northwest of UGC 1274 is a 10th magnitude star (SAO 92644) that has a wide companion, and also 8' southwest is a closer and fainter double star.  So, I think these conditions are met and Corwin concurs this identification is likely.

Following my suggestion, Corwin found that IC 151 and IC 152, found by Swift on 11 Aug 1890, might have similar RA errors of 5 minutes, matching UGC 1271 and NGC 677.  The declinations match to within 1' and the RA differences match as well.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 161 = Sw IX-3 on 3 Oct 1889 or 8 Jan 1891, and recorded "eeF; S; cE, between 2 dist star in meridian."  He returned to the field in January 1891 and recorded IC 161 again, as well as IC 162 (list X-11 and X-12).   It's not certain whether his first observation in 1889 refers to the southwest or northeast member of this pair.  To further confuse the situation, the entry for List X-11 is 10' too far south and Dreyer used the erroneous dec for IC 161.

UGC, CGCG and MCG all misidentify IC 161 = UGC 1266 as IC 162 and don't assign an IC designation to IC 162 = UGC 1267.  See Corwin's notes on IC 161 and 162 as well as Malcolm's Thomson's IC Corrections.

Arp placed IC 162 in his category of "concentric rings".  V-V classified this galaxy as an interacting pair (VV 53), but the galaxy looks single on the SDSS.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 162 = Sw X-11 in January 1891 or perhaps earlier on 3 Oct 1889 (list IX-3).  The interpretation depends on which single galaxy he picked up in 1889.  Furthermore, Swift's position for List  XI-11 is 10' too far south.  The UGC, CGCG and MCG misidentify IC 161 (southwestern member of the pair) as IC 162.

His position is 1' S of NGC 684.  In Astronomische Nachrichten #3429, Isaac Roberts noted the equivalence of IC 165 and NGC 684 and Dreyer repeated this identity in the IC 2 notes.

18" (12/22/11): easily picked up at 175x though at this power appeared as a faint, fairly small, roundish glow.  At 285x ~10-12 mag 14-15.5 stars are resolved with a couple at the edge of visibility over a mottled background.  Roughly 3.5' diameter.  A brighter mag 12.5 star is at the west edge.

17.5" (8/5/97): position identified at 100x using a GSC chart, although only a couple of stars are plotted.  Appears as a very faint circular glow with a couple of faint stars superimposed.  Located 7' E of a wide pair of mag 9/11 stars [at 38" separation].  Does not resemble a cluster in appearance and would have otherwise thought this was a Milky Way patch. At 220x, the glow is ~4' in diameter and there are a sprinkling of ~10 very faint stars, mostly mag 14.5-15.5 with one mag 13 star.  The glow has an irregular surface brightness with a mottled appearance and the periphery is not well defined.

William Denning discovered IC 166 around 1890 with his 10-inch With-Browning reflector.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer.  The IC position corresponds with the faint open cluster Tombaugh 3 = OCL-334 = Lund 60. 

Clyde Tombaugh independently found IC 166 in Jan/Feb of 1941 while surveying the circumpolar region from Lowell Observatory with the 13-inch Lowell telescope.  He tentatively identified "Tombaugh 3" as an open cluster, though thought is might be a loose globular or "even a midget galaxy just beyond the border of our Milky Way System".

Edward Swift discovered IC 188 = Sw IX-8, along with IC 187, on 18 Jan 1890, while searching for "Swift's Comet".  Described as "eeef, vS; R; 2 stars point to it."  There is nothing at his position, but 10 sec of RA west and 30' south is UGC 1510, and there is a pair of 12th magnitude stars to the north-northwest that could fit Swift's description.  

But due to the large error in declination Malcolm Thomson rejects UGC 1510 as IC 188.  He argues that no similar error occurred with nearby IC 187, and if he did find this galaxy, the description would have mentioned "sp of 2" and "nf of 2." for the pair.   No modern catalogue identifies UGC 1510 as IC 188.  So this identification is quite uncertain.  See Harold Corwin's IC identification notes as well as Courtney Seligman's summary.

Sherburne Wesley Burnham discovered IC 259, along with IC 258, on 3 Sep 1891 while observing double stars with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He measured the offsets for both objects correctly with respect to 10th magnitude BD +40°608.  But he applied his RA (time) offset in the wrong direction for the western object, which he described as double.  So the computed position for IC 258 is east of IC 259, placing these objects out of RA order in the sky.  As a result, the identifications of IC 258 and IC 259 are reversed in UGC, CGCG, PGC, HyperLeda, WikiSky, etc.  NED has the correct identifications.

Stephane Javelle found IC 261 = J. 1-98 on 7 Dec 1891.  His position matches MCG -03-08-028 = PGC 10664.  This galaxy was discovered by Leavenworth on 1 Jan 1886 and catalogued as list 1-72 (later NGC 1120), but Leavenworth's RA (to the nearest minute) is 1 minute too small (common error).  Corwin confirms Leavenworth's sketch matches this galaxy, so it is certain IC 261 = NGC 1120. Some sources, such as the MCG, label this galaxy IC 261 although NGC 1120 should be the primary designation.  See Corwin's notes.

Weakly annular with a slightly brighter rim and irregularly lit darker center that contains a very faint central star.  A thin, very low surface brightness outer halo is more elongated along the minor axis, creating a roughly circular halo.

18" (11/13/07): at 300x appeared fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated NW-SE, ~35"x30" with an irregular surface brightness.  The rim was very slightly brighter than the interior with a strong impression of irregularities.  The rim sometimes appeared slightly brighter along the north side or contained a very faint stellar knot.  At 450x, there was an occasional faint sparkle in the interior, but I was uncertain if it was the central star.  Located 1.8' N of a mag 10 star.  A mag 14 star lies just 45" NE.

Situated 2' N of a mag 10 star and near the tip of two curving strings of stars which head north and NW from IC 289.  Excellent view at 380x - the planetary is slightly elongated and has a mottled appearance with a marginally brighter rim, particularly on the W or NW side, giving an impression of weak annularity.  At moments, there was a brief sparkle at the center, possibly the central star.  A mag 14 star is 45" NE of center and a mag 13 star lies 1.3' following.

Barnard send the discovery notice directly to Dreyer at some point so it also has the designation IC 1889.  Swift placed IC 295 close southeast, but there is nothing there.  IC 296 = Sw VIII-21, discovered by Swift just 3 nights later, is perhaps another observation (position matches and nothing else nearby he might have picked up, except for faint stars).

The ring component (no nucleus) just west is a faint, small, irregularly round glow, ~20" diameter with a low but very uneven surface brightness.

This is a remarkable pair of disrupted galaxies (Arp 147) forming a "10" or "IC" on images.  The fainter western component (collisional Ring), forming the "C" or "0" was not visible.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 298 = J 2-580 on 29 Dec 1893 and recorded "Small, nearly round, 1 'in diameter. It looks like the nebula covers two very small bright spots."

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 314 = Big. 140 on 14 Dec 1887.  His position matches UGC 2666 = PGC 12342.  This galaxy was discovered by Lewis Swift on 1 Sep 1886 and described as "vF; S; R; 4 st following in a row.", but his RA was off by 11 seconds.  Howe measured an accurate micrometric position for NGC 1289 and reported "the "4 st following" are of about mag 10, and are not close together, the farthest being perhaps 10' from the nebula."  It's clear that IC 314 = NGC 1289, although Dreyer didn't make the connection.

24" (2/7/16): IC 316 is a spectacular interacting/merging pair of spiral galaxies with the nuclei of the two galaxies separated by only 11".  The close duo is embedded in a irregular common halo about 1' across.  At 226x, a single fairly faint glow was seen, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~25" diameter.  At 452x (10mm ZAO + 2x Powermate), I immediately noticed a nearly stellar nucleus [of the northern face-on spiral] offset near the north edge creating an unusual appearance.  Often a very faint "spike" [the southern edge-on spiral] was seen close south of the stellar nucleus, angling towards the southeast, ~15"x5".

17.5" (1/7/89): faint, small, oval ~N-S, weak concentration.  Located 5' ENE of IC 313 in AGC 426.  A companion is superimposed 0.2' S, but the merged systems were not resolved.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 316 = Sw VIII-34, along with IC 313, on 14 Sep 1888 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R."  So, Swift did not resolve the two nuclei.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 324 on 3 Dec 1888.  His position matches ESO 548-019 = PGC 12846, which was discovered by William Herschel in 1799 and catalogued as H III-959 (later NGC 1331).  His single position on this sweep is 22 seconds of RA too small and happens to fall close to ESO 548-016 = PGC 12827, a galaxy too faint to have been seen by Herschel. In the "Scientific Papers of William Herschel", Dreyer notes for NGC 1331: "This is IC 324, 11 seconds following, 1.2' S of NGC 1332.  NGC 1331 is to be struck out."  The RNGC misidentifies ESO 548-016 as NGC 1331.

17.5" (12/16/95): very unusual galaxy, appears as a very faint, very large glow surrounding a 1' high surface brightness core that increases to a bright stellar nucleus.  The irregular halo is difficult to trace but extends to ~10' diameter with a number of superimposed stars including a striking 6' string of six mag 10.5-12.5 stars oriented NW-SE on the southwest side of the halo.  No arm structure was seen.  The core forms a small triangle with two similar superimposed mag 11 stars 1.0' N and 2.0' NE.  Situated just 10.6° above the galactic plane and suffers from significant dust obscuration.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 342 on 11 Aug 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "with 500x it is quite a bright object, 1/2' dia and quite [?], mbM, not cometary.  Object 1' S of this star [shown on sketch] and following 3s or 4s." His rough position and sketch (showing the superimposed linear strings of stars) is an excellent match.

William Denning independently discovered IC 342 on 19 Aug 1892 while comet hunting with his 10-inch reflector.  The discovery was announced in a short note, "New nebula", Astronomy and Astro-Physics, 12, 189 (1893).  As Barnard never published his discovery or informed Dreyer, Denning is credited with the discovery in the IC.

In a note by Hubble and Seyfert titled "A Spiral Nebula of Unusually Large Dimensions" (Harvard College Observatory Bulletin No. 899, pp.16-17): "In a letter written to Dr. J. L. Dreyer before 1894, Mr. W. F. Denning, the well known meteor observer of Bristol, included in a short list of new nebulae an object in the position 3h 37m 8s, +67d 46.9' (1900), which was simply described as "pretty bright, very small, star of 12th magnitude close to nucleus."

Hubble and Humason (1934), first recognized this object as a spiral galaxy and suggested the possibility that IC 342 was a possible Local Group member (heavily reddened) based on its recessional velocity, though it was later shown to be too distant.  IC 342 is one of the brightest members of the IC 342/Maffei Group that incudes NGC 1560, NGC 1569 and highly obscured Maffei I and 2.

John Herschel discovered IC 344 = h305 = LM(S) 163 = Sw IX-13 on 17 Oct 1827 and simply recorded "the first of 3 [with H II-455 and H II-456]".  His position matches MCG -01-10-020 = PGC 13568, although he thought the object was identical with H-III 569 = NGC 1397. So, both the GC (756) and NGC (1397) misidentify h305 as H III-569.  As a result, h305 did not receive a separate NGC designation and IC 344 is JH's only discovery with an IC designation.  This galaxy was also observed at Birr Castle (and missed on several occasions).

Lewis Swift independently found the galaxy again on 23 Dec 1889, reported "eeF; pL; R; passed in line with 1417-18; cometary; unable to refind it; seeing good.  Failed also at Harvard College Observatory [during a visit]."  Frank Muller also found it in late 1887 while measuring positions for NGC 1417 and 1418.  Dreyer credited both JH (h305) and Swift in the IC.  Sherburne Burnham measured IC 344 (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) and correctly sorted out the confusion with JH's observation.

17.5" (12/16/95): IC 348 is an unusual object consisting of a scattered group of stars with associated nebulosity situated near a large dark cloud virtually devoid of stars.  The cluster consists of 15 stars of varying magnitudes in a 6' group located 5'-10' S of Omicron = 38 Persei (V = 3.8).  The brightest star in the group is mag 8.4 SAO 56680, which has two nearby companions and the group is clearly encased in a fairly bright reflection nebula, ~3' diameter.  The star at the southwest end of the cluster is a nice close evenly matched double (∑437 = 9.8/10 at 11").  The immediate 50' low power field to the south is strangely devoid of almost all stars! (Barnard 3 and 4).  Omicron also has a halo but this appears to be scattered light.

Truman Safford discovered IC 348 = Sf 70 on 1 Dec 1866 and recorded "vL, pB, vgbM."  He added the footnote "a loose cluster with nebula" and his position is accurate.  E.E. Barnard independently discovered the nebulosity near Omicron Persei (though not a cluster) on a plate taken 6 Dec 1893 at Lick Observatory and Dreyer catalogued it again as IC 1985.

48" (10/31/13):  IC 349 is a reflection knot just 36" SSE of Merope.  We used 813x and carefully placed Merope barely outside the north edge of the field.  The orientation was easy to judge using two 15th magnitude stars 1.8' S and 1.8' SSW of Merope and the elongated glow fell between the diffraction spikes.  Despite the glare from Merope making the observation much more difficult, I was surprised this small reflection nebula was fairly bright and elongated (roughly pointing south from Merope) with a straighter western edge, perhaps 20"x10" in size.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 349, a fan-shaped knot of nebulosity just 0.6' SSE of Merope, visually on 14 Nov 1890 using the Lick 36" refractor.  It was announced in a discovery note in AN 3018.  "On Nov. 14 while examining the cluster, I discovered a new and comparatively bright round cometary nebula close south and following Merope, every precaution was taken to prove that it was not a ghost of Merope by examining the other stars of the group under the same conditions.  I have since seen it several times and on Dec. 8th I could see it with some difficulty in the 12-inch by occulting Merope with a wire in the eyepiece.  With the great telescope the nebula can be seen fairly well with Merope in the field and is conspicuous when the star is placed just outside the north edge of the field.  It is about 30" in diameter, of the 13th mag, gradually brighter in the middle, and very cometary in appearance.  It was examined with powers of 300, 520 and 1500, with all of which it was comparatively easy."

At 220x, this high surface brightness PN was clearly nonstellar and slightly oval with a hint of a sparkle (central star) at the center.  At 500x, appeared as a small, well-defined disc, elongated 4:3 SW-NE with dimensions ~7"x5".  The quasi-stellar center was brighter with a small, fainter halo that seemed irregular.  A couple of faint stars are close west and north.  Located 3.5' NW of a distinctive trio of mag 10/11/13 stars.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 351 on 5 Dec 1890 with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory, while examining the region near Comet Zona.  He estimated a diameter of 4.6" and a magnitude of 10.5-11.  Sherburne Burnham measured a diameter of 10".

Based on a Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) described, "central star can be made out and is perhaps as bright as mag 14.  The nebula shows a minute elliptical disk, which is 8"x6" in PA 10° in a 5 minute exposure.  An elongated brighter patch is in the center."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 356 on 23 Aug 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  His simple eyepiece sketch clearly identifies the neighboring stars.  Barnard didn't publish his discovery until 1892 (AN 3097) in response to an independent discovery by William Denning on 7 Nov 1890 (Observatory, 15, 104 (1892)).  Barnard's article was titled "Two Probably Variable Nebulae".  In the article he mentions "from its brightness it is not possible that it has been so conspicuous for any great length of time, or it would surely have been found by Swift and others."

Both Barnard and Denning are credited in the IC.  Denning was a bit peeved about Barnard's late discovery note and wrote "Mr. Barnard claims to have discovered [IC 356] in August 1889 whereas I did not pick it up until Nov 1890.  While admitting this claim, I would venture to remark that anyone who makes a discovery ought to be prompt in announcing it, as a delay of several years is very likely to cause misconception and unnecessary trouble to others.  I think that in ordinary cases priority of announcement ought to be accepted as priority of discovery."  He also questioned Barnard's claim that the nebula had recent brightened, stating "I have picked up this object many times during the last two years  without noticing any change in it other than can be fully accounted for by differences  in atmospheric conditions."

But perhaps Barnard wasn't the first to discover this galaxy.  Swift claimed (Astro-Physics, Vol XI, 566) an earlier discovery before 1879 based on marking the object on his Burritt's star atlas, though he didn't record or remember any particulars, stating he thought his early discoveries were all known!

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 361 on 10 Oct 1890 with the 6 1/2" refractor at Lick Observatory.  He recorded in his logbook, "In 6 1/2 inch it is apparently a very faint nebula between two or three stars.  In 12-inch (175x) it is pL, excessively faint and seems to be an excessively faint cluster or extremely faint stars, with possibly some nebulosity - power too high."  His simple sketch shows the cluster on line with two 6th magnitude stars to the southwest and the identity is certain.   William Denning found it again on 11 Feb 1893 with his 10-inch reflector (see The Observatory, 41, 140) and is credited with the discovery in the IC as Barnard never published his discovery or notified Dreyer.

24" (1/4/14): at 125x unfiltered; emission nebulosity is evident surrounding and beyond the borders of open cluster NGC 1893, but the only a large patch to the northwest of the cluster stands out well.  A UHC filter transformed the nebula to a showpiece and it appeared bright, very large (~30' diameter), very irregular with a large darker patch to the west of the central portion of the cluster.  The brightest section of nebulosity is to the NW of the cluster (as noticed without a filter), though mag 9.0 HD 242908 (a hot 04-type star) at the NW tip of the cluster is at the east edge of this bright, 6' circular patch.  Somewhat fainter nebulosity envelops the entire cluster but an extensive field of nebulosity continuous south of the cluster for an additional 10'.  It was difficult to see a clean edge on the south and west side as the nebulosity seems to gradually fade away, but the entire diameter is at least 25'.

The cometary "Tadpoles" nebulae Simeis 130 and 129, which contain recently minted stars, lie on the east end of the cluster.  The "head" of Simeis 130 was immediately picked up at 200x as a very small, fairly high surface brightness knot with at least one star involved.  At 260x and 375, two very close "stars" oriented WSW-ENE were embedded in the glow, with the ENE object quasi-stellar (would not focus to a sharp point) and perhaps a very tight pair. Although impressive on images, there was no sign of the wavy tail extending from the "head" towards the NE.  Mag 9.1 BD+33 1028, 3' E of Simeis 130, along with a 6' group of a half-dozen mag 10-11 stars, were visually detached to the NE of the main cluster.

13.1" (1/18/85): very faint nebulosity involved with open cluster NGC 1893.  The brightest portion is at the NW edge of cluster.  A dark "hole" is just south of this nebulosity.  More extensive nebulosity is suspected but difficult to confirm due to the general background haze of the cluster.  Enhanced with UHC and OIII filters.

13.1" (2/25/84): nebulosity is evident preceding the NW star of the triangle of stars surrounding the cluster.  Very faint but definite with a filter in poor transparency.

17.5" (12/26/00): this is the northwest member of an unusual close pair of interacting galaxies with IC 413 -- just 35" separation (in PA 115°) and both members appearing to extend from a mag 12 star (30" from centers to star)!  Both galaxies are faint, very small, slightly elongated, ~25"x15", with small brighter cores.  IC 412 is elongated SSW-NNE and 30" SW of the mag 12 star - with the NE end just west of the star.  Located 6' SSW of mag 7.6 SAO 112679 and 14' WSW of the (32") mag 5/7 double 23 Orionis.  A third galaxy, IC 414, is in the field 8.5' S, forming the poor galaxy cluster WBL 114.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 412 = IC 2123, along with IC 413 = IC 2124, on 30 Oct 1888 while sweeping with the 12-inch telescope of Lick Observatory.  He noted "the nebulae are very small, roundish, mbM.  Close south of a small star."  His field sketch confirms the identification.  Sherburne Burnham who discovered nearby IC 414, also observed and measured the pair at Lick Observatory (Publ of Lick Observatory, II).  The discovery was communicated at some point directly to Dreyer.

Stephane Javelle independently found the pair (J. 608 and 609) on 12 Jan 1894.  These observations became IC 412 and 413 (Javelle's descriptions used), though Barnard is also credited. So IC 412 = IC 2123 and IC 413 = IC 2124.  See Corwin's notes.

17.5" (2/9/02): this large HII region encases the open cluster Stock 8 and is situated ~6' SE of 5th magnitude Phi Aurigae.  At 140x, the cluster consists of 40-50 stars including two mag 10 (the brightest is the wide double ∑707 = 9.7/11.4 at 18") and numerous mag 12-14 stars.  With a UHC filter (or OIII filter at 100x), the cluster is encased in a moderately bright glow, ~8'x5'.  The nebulosity is brightest in a triangular wedge, tapering towards the south with the two mag 10 stars oriented N-S (2' separation) along the western boundary.  The glow is irregular but has a fairly sharp border along the western edge.

V = 9.3;  Size 12"

48" (2/18/12): at 488x, the sharply defined, vivid raspberry annulus appeared relatively thin and extended NNW-SSE, ~14"x12".  The high contrast central dark hole was striking surrounding the bright central star.  Surrounding the annulus is a faint outer halo, increasing the size to roughly 20".

48" (4/2/11): truly impressive view at 375x and 488x, which revealed a very high surface brightness, slightly elongated halo, ~14"x12", surrounding the very bright central star.  I was surprised to see the planetary was clearly annular with a very bright, irregular rim that varied slightly in thickness and a fairly high contrast darker hole surrounding the central star.  The ring's outer rim was a shocking, deep raspberry color.  The color was more intense at 375x and slightly more saturated along one-half of the annulus.

18" (1/26/09): striking view at 175x with the mag 10.5 central star blazing within a 10" disc with a crisply defined halo.  Excellent contrast gain using an H-beta filter with the central star nearly lost with the high surface brightness disc.  There appears to be a very faint, thin envelope surrounding the main 10" disc extending a few arc seconds.  At 285x, the planetary is slightly oval NNW-SSE with subtle variations in surface brightness; slightly weaker around the central star and slightly brighter along portions of the rim.

18" (1/15/07): at 115x, the bright mag 10.5 central star is surrounded by a small 10" disc with a noticeable raspberry tint.

17.5" (2/22/03): at 100x, the bright 10.5 magnitude central star was centered in a 10" round halo with a definite rosy or raspberry tint at the outer edge of the halo, though the effect is fairly subtle.  Using an H-beta filter, the central star is strongly dimmed but the halo is significantly enhanced, dramatically changing the view of this planetary.  At 380x, no color was visible but the halo was a bit asymmetrical with a "softer" edge and possible double shell structure.  The center was very slightly darker around the central star.

17.5" (12/30/99): at 82x the mag 10.5 central star was enveloped in a very small round halo which appeared to have a slight reddish tinge at its edge.  This is a low-excitation PN and using a H-beta filter, the halo brightened and the central star faded, leaving a more noticeable disc.  At 220x, the prominent central star was surrounded by a well-defined 10" halo that partially "blinked" on and off switching from averted to direct vision.  At 280x, the small halo was possibly surrounded by an extremely faint envelope, but this could not be confirmed.  380x and 500x presented a superb view of the inner disc which appeared weakly annular.

17.5" (3/8/97): unusually bright mag 10.5 central star surrounded by a small high surface brightness halo.  At 220x, this planetary has a distinct "blinking" effect; staring at central star partially washes out the halo and with averted the halo is more dominant.  At 82x, an unusual rosy tinge is evident at the edge of the small halo, although the effect is fairly subdued.  The seeing was not steady enough for high power viewing of the outer shell.

17.5": high surface brightness planetary, appears very bright at 481x.  Contains a bright "fuzzy" central star with a bright inner portion surrounded by a second fainter shell slightly elongated N-S. 

13" (10/20/84): very bright, small, takes 350-410x well, bright central star, subtle shell structure. 

8" (2/5/81): nearly stellar at 100x, bright, appears as a mag 10 star with a small, faint bluish halo.

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 418 on 26 Mar 1891 based on a spectrum plate taken at Harvard College Observatory.  In a letter communicated by Pickering in AN 3049, she mentioned the hydrogen spectrum was unusually large for a planetary.  Pickering is attributed with the discovery in the NGC.

Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) reported, "central star of mag 19, surrounded by a bright somewhat elliptical ring 14"x11" in outside diameter, and about 12"x10" along its central line; pa 163°."  Walter Scott Houston may have made the first visual observation in 1945 using a 10" reflector.

A star is plotted at this position on the Uranometria 2000.0 Atlas because the BD catalogue included the central star.

IC 434 = LBN 953 = Sh 2-277 = Ced 55n
05 41 00 -02 24
Size 60'x10'

13.1" (1/11/86): using an H-beta filter IC 434 appears a very faint, very large, very elongated strip of nebulosity running south of Zeta Orionis for almost one degree in a N-S direction.  There is a well-defined sharp edge along the east side while the west side fades off into the background.  Contains the famous dark nebula B33 = "Horsehead Nebula" as a dark "notch".  IC 434 extends beyond NGC 2023 off the east edge and the star density drops off significantly east of IC 434 whereas a number of faint stars are pepper the field to the west of IC 434.  This is one of the few emission nebulae that responds very well to a H-Beta filter.  Extremely difficult without filter.

24" (1/21/12): the view of the Horsehead through a 24" f/4.1 Starmaster using a Collins I3 image intensifier mated with a narrowband H-alpha filter at the Mauna Kea visitor center (9300') was absolutely stunning.  The outline stood out in extremely sharp relief like a photograph and the dark cloud was pitch black against the bright background.  I'm not sure of the magnification used but the field was 30' or less and the Horsehead was large enough to show exquisite detail in the outline.

17.5" (12/26/00 and 12/28/00): at 100x using an H-beta filter, the huge IC 434 strip was very prominent and easy to follow south from Zeta Orionis throughout the entire 50' field of view.  The boundary was razor-sharp along its eastern edge against a background sky darkened by the H-beta filter.  The Horsehead was very easy to view as a nearly black, semi-circular 4' indentation that protruded into the nebulosity.  With averted vision there was a short extension or knob on the north side.  This forms the snout of the horse and with concentration faint nebulosity is visible just below (east) of the snout.

17.5" (10/8/88): easily held with direct vision using the H-beta filter.  The head or snout protrudes to the north.

17.5" (9/14/85 and 10/12/85): the Horsehead Nebula appears as a jet black dark nebula using an H-beta filter at 84x superimposed against the fairly prominent emission nebula IC 434.  Appears as a semi-circular indentation or "bite" of 5' diameter along the sharply defined eastern edge of IC 434 "strip" which extends through field in a N-S orientation.  Significant contrast gain with and H-Beta filter which renders the background sky and B33 extremely dark.  Difficult to see the "snout" feature which protrudes to the north but it is detectable.  Mag 8.5 SAO 132451 lies 8' N. 

13" (1/18/85): visible with direct vision with H-Beta filter and striking with averted.  The snout was suspected.  The contrast between B33 and the sky was high with the background jet black and sharply outlined against the easy glow of IC 434.  Best view with 24mm.

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 434 on Harvard College Observatory plates in 1883. Edward Pickering announced the discovery (along with a number of other Orion nebulae) in the 1890 Harvard Annals publication (1890AnHar..18..113P).  She also described the dark notch (later dubbed the "Horsehead") as "A large nebulosity extending nearly south the Zeta Orionis for about 60'.  More intense and well marked on the following side with a semicircular indentation 5' in diameter 30' south of Zeta. All good plates of this region show this object, and it has been used here as a test for some time." Dreyer didn't mention the "indentation" in the IC description.

Harold Corwin comments that "Some people have suggested that it was actually found by WH.  This is not true; WH's comment (see Latusseck, J. Astron. Data 14, 4, 2008 where it is reprinted) "Wonderful black space included in Nebulosities" refers to NGC 2024, not to IC 434."

But Wolfgang notes that on 1 Feb 1786 (sweep 518), WH recorded a large region of nebulosity extending roughly 2° north-south, not far east of IC 434.  He noted "I am pretty sure the places of which these are the boundaries are all full of diffused milky nebulosity; but notwithstanding I used every means of ascertaining it by motion of the telescope, my range was neither far enough, nor sufficiently quick to put it beyond doubt.  He assigned it internal discovery number (1321), which became H. V 35 (first of 4 different fields associated with that designation).  Wolfgang Steinicke feels it may apply to IC 434, though Herschel's RA is about 3 minutes too large, so this identification is very uncertain.

Howe noted the equivalence in his survey of IC objects (Monthly Notices, Nov. 1900) and discovered nearby IC 2151.

24" (2/7/16): IC 442 was picked up at 226x (10mm ZAO) as a fairly faint, fairly small round glow, ~18" diameter.  Adding a 2x Powermate (452x), two extremely close nuclei [separated by 8"] were resolved within the halo!  The nucleus in the south-southwest part of the halo (PGC 2787456) was almost seen continuously in periods of fairly steady seeing, while the north-northeast nucleus (PGC 19306) was a bit more subtle.  Both were stellar or quasi-stellar and towards the outer edges of the halo.

William Denning discovered IC 442 on 9 Nov 1890 while comet seeiking in Camelopardus with his 10-inch reflector.  He noted "F, S, R, mbM"

18" (2/23/06): easily visible at 73x and OIII filter.  The brightest portion is a 5' elongated strip that very gently curves WNW-ESE.  Faint haze extends out from this strip towards the south and west.  An extremely faint extension of the strip continues to the SE and curves towards an obtuse triangle of three stars, increasing the length of the edge of the shell to over 10'.

17.5" (1/16/02): at 64x and OIII filter, the most prominent section of this supernova remnant is a gently curving band of nebulosity oriented NW-SE, ~10'x3' with a well-defined edge along the eastern (bowed-out) boundary. A larger region of low surface brightness haze, ~20' in size, spreads out to the west of the northern end.  At the SE end, the band dims and seems to hook to the SW towards a small arrowhead of stars.  Located ~2.5 degrees SE of M35 and following mag 3.3 Eta Gem.

17.5" (1/20/90): at 82x with OIII filter this supernova remnant appears moderately bright, large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE.  Appears a bit larger and brighter at the NW end.  Much fainter nebulosity is close south off the west end and a couple of mag 10 stars are superimposed. Surprisingly easy to view with an OIII filter.

13.1" (1/18/85): at 62x with filter, appears as a very faint elongated strip of nebulosity, perhaps 10' in length.? Not visible without a filter.

Max Wolf discovered IC 443, along with IC 444, on 25 Sep 1892 with a 2 1/4" lens.  In AN 3130 (1892), he recorded finding "[Two] Very large and bright nebulous masses are visible there [near Mu and Eta Geminorum], which very roughly have their centers at approximately 6h 14m +24° [IC 444] and 6h 08m +22° [IC 443]."

E.E. Barnard independently discovered these two nebulae in 1894 and his report appeared in "Astronomy and Astro-Physics", Vol 8, No. 3, page 177, 1894.  Harold Corwin quotes Barnard's description, "On this same plate [taken on 1 Feb 1894 with a 2h 10m exposure] is a faint narrow curved nebulosity in about, 1860.0, 6h 8m + 23° 0'.  It is nearly 1/2° long, extending north and south and convex to the east."

17.5" (1/23/93): fairly faint reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10-11 star. This bi-polar nebula is fairly large, about 2.5' diameter.  Appears to extend further (or is brighter) on the south side.  Bordered by three collinear mag 13 stars on the south side.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 446 = IC 2167, along with IC 2169, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "a 9 1/2 mag star with largish faint nebula, a little heavier following."  

He later found it again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the Willard 6" lens and announced it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Based on this discovery note, Dreyer catalogued it as IC 446.  Barnard states, though, he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweep over this region..I also found a 10 mag nebulous star about half a degree north preceding 2245."  His position in this paper is accurate.  Apparently Barnard also sent Dreyer his original visual discovery, hence the two IC designations.  In any case, IC 446 = IC 2167.  This object is a bi-polar reflection nebula. Listed in article on bi-polar nebulae by Ronald Stoyan in Deep Sky Observer #12.

24" (1/31/14): picked up unfiltered at 200x, though low contrast as the entire field is patchy in faint stars and affected by some dust.  Seems roughly 20'x10, elongated N-S and includes several bright stars (Cr 95) with mag 7.9 HD 46005 near the center (illuminating star), mag 8.9 HD 258853 near the south end, and a mag 9.3 star at or beyond the NW end.  The contrast is significantly improved at 125x using a NPB filter and the outline is better defined, particularly at the southern end.  Although the nebulosity is slightly brighter to the south of HD 46005, there are no high surface brightness sections.

18" (2/4/08): at 175x unfiltered, this is a huge, interesting reflection nebula, ~25'x18', elongated N-S with an irregular outline and subtle variations in brightness.  A number of mag 8-10 stars are superimposed, including mag 8 HD 46005 (illuminating star) which is part of a 10' N-S string of four brighter stars on the east side. Nearby reflection nebulae include NGC 2245 ~30' NE, IC 446 35' N and NGC 2247 40' NE (this group forms the association Monoceros R1).

IC 2169 is located two degrees due west of the Christmas Tree cluster and the whole region of bright and dark nebulosity is part of the same molecular cloud complex Mon OB1.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 447 = IC 2169, along with IC 446 = IC 2167, on 11 Oct 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "1 radius of 80x field [21'] south and 1 radius [21'] preceding the 7 1/2' m star [NGC 2245] is a large nebulosity, faint, that involves several 9 or 9 1/2 mag star.  Nearly 1/2° in size, irregular(?)".  His offset lands in the southern part of the nebula, though clearly he was referring the entire portion.  This discovery was not published but later sent directly to Dreyer.  He picked it up again on 26 Feb 1889 and logged "22' S and 22' p. the neb NGC 2245 is a vL neby, with some bright stars in it.  It is extended N & S nearly, 15 x 12' +/- diam.  There are 3 or 4 9th and 10th mag stars in a curve seemingly connected with it."

He found this reflection nebula again photographically on 24 Jan 1894 with the Willard 6" lens though and announced it in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Cluster Connected with the Milky Way" (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol XIII, No 3).  Barnard stated he first found it visually around 1888 "while sweep over this region, I found a very large, weak, diffused nebulosity some half a degree south of the nebula NGC 2245. This was mixed up with several considerable stars."  As a result, it was catalogued twice (IC 2169 = IC 447).

Barnard retracted his discovery of IC 447 in Lick Publications, Vol 11, incorrectly claiming it to be identical to NGC 2245.  Hubble included this object in his 1922 paper "A general study of diffuse galactic nebula" in Contributions from the Mount Wilson Observatory / Carnegie Institution of Washington, vol. 241, pp.1-38.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 452 = Big. 147, along with IC 453 = Big. 148 on 9 Mar 1890 while searching for NGC 2296.  Swift's discovery position was 0.7 min of RA too far east and 1' too far south, so Bigourdan assumed Big. 147 (later IC 452) was new.  Herbert Howe later measured an accurate RA for NGC 2296 in 1898 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes) so, NGC 2296 = IC 452.  His position for Big. 148 (IC 453) points directly to a star, according to Corwin.

Contains a slightly brighter nucleus, which is close southeast of the star.  There may be one or two additional mag 15.5-16 star near the periphery.  Since the galaxy appears to extend from the brighter star it has a comet-like appearance.  Situated in a rich Milky Way star field.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 454 = Sw IX-16 on 21 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "a faint nebula, elongated with 13 mag star attached to end N.p."  His rough RA (in his notebook) is about 24 seconds too large, but his small field sketch matches.  The discovery was probably not communicated to Dreyer as Barnard isn't credited in the IC.

Lewis Swift independently found this galaxy on 27 Dec 1889 and simply noted "eeF; S; e diff."  Swift's RA is 9 seconds too large and he gets the credit in the IC.  Howe measured an accurate position in 1898 and noted, "One or two stars are involved in this nebula."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 455 on 20 Sep 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  While comet hunting in the north, Barnard found NGC 2276, 2300 and IC 455.  He was confused on his pointing direction this far north, but made a field sketch including nearby stars and labeled the nebulae A (NGC 2276), B (NGC 2300) and C (IC 455, outside the 150x field).  He noted "C is 10' S and 3' foll B.  A is 2' diameter, faint, vglbM."  The sketch clearly identifies the three galaxies.  William Denning independently discovered IC 455 less than a month later on 17 Oct 1890 with his 10-inch reflector.

His position matches PGC 20272, which was discovered by Bindon Stoney at Birr Castle on 2 Jan 1851.  Although placed fairly accurately on a constructed diagram, no absolute positions were found so Dreyer relied on Bigourdan's measurement.  Unfortunately, Bigourdan's position refers to a faint star so the NGC position for NGC 2330 is erroneous.

Unfortunately, Bigourdan's position refers to a faint star so the NGC position for NGC 2334 is erroneous.  Assuming PGC 20357 is the galaxy Dreyer had in mind as NGC 2330 (Malcolm Thomson disagrees), then NGC 2334 = IC 465 = PGC 20357.  MCG, CGCG, PGC, SIMBAD all label this galaxy as IC 465 and not NGC 2334.  NED and HyperLeda give the equivalence.

Stephane Javelle found IC 547 = J. 1-165 on 20 Apr 1892 and recorded "pB, small, round, 20" diameter, weak concentration".  His position matches MCG -02-25-004 = PGC 27309.  This galaxy was discovered by Leavenworth on 6 May 1886, but his rough position was 2 minutes of RA too large.  Since NGC 2947 matches in declination, and the Leander McCormick positions are generally 1 to 2 minutes of RA too large, the identification NGC 2947 = IC 547 is likely.  This galaxy was found a third time by Swift and catalogued as IC 2494, with an accurate position from Howe.  Dreyer missed the two IC equivalences.  MCG labels the galaxy as IC 547 only.

This galaxy was probably discovered by William Herschel on 15 Mar 1784 and catalogued as H III-34 (later h633 and NGC 2984), but his position was unusually poor -- 1 min 19 sec of RA west and 3.5' south of IC 556.  Karl Reinmuth mentioned he couldn't find NGC 2984 in Dreyer's place using Heidelberg plates and questioned if it was equal to IC 556.  This is likely the case as there are no other reasonable candidates for NGC 2984 in the vicinity.  UGC, CGCG and MCG label this galaxy as IC 556 and RNGC calls it NGC 2984.

The galaxy appears as a fairly bright oval, elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.6'x0.4', with a small bright core.  There was only a hint of the dust lane but narrow extensions or spikes were visible poking out on the NW and SE end, with the SE extension brighter. A mag 15.2 star is 1.3' NNE and two mag 13 and 14.5 stars are 2.3' SE and 1.7' SE, respectively

There are two close companions but I only noted 2MASX J09543313-0650143 1.2' N.  The observation was made during a period of fairly poor transparency and seeing so this galaxy would be worth revisiting.

The three fainter components flank HCG 54A and together nearly merge to create an irregular extended glow ~50"x18", bending to the north on the east end.

HCG 54B, at the southwest end, is faint to fairly faint (B = 16.2), very small, round, ~8"-10" diameter. This is the second brightest of the 4 members.  On the SDSS, HCG 54B appears as a very compact, bright blue knot just 15" SW of center of IC 700.

HCG 54C was easily seen as a faint (B = 17.2), small, round, 10" knot.  HCG 54C is squeezed between fainter HCG 54D and HCG 54A (18" NE of the center of HCG 54A).

HCG 54D was not noticed at 613x.  At 813x it appeared very faint (B = 18.5), round, only a 6" knot.  HCG 54D is the faintest member of the quartet and sits at the northeast end of the chain.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 700 = J. 1-198 on 28 Apr 1892 with the 30-inch refractor at Nice.  His position matches HCG 54A = UGC 6487.  Harold Corwin notes that "his description "Nearly round, about 40 arcsec in diameter, a little brighter toward the middle" suggests he saw at least the brightest three of the objects, blended into a single image."  HCG 54 is considered a post-merger of 2 or more galaxies.

Frank Muller found IC 717 on 14 Feb 1888 with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick Observatory and described it as "1.0'x0.8', E 90°, dif."  With respect to NGC 3775, he measured an offset of +53.92 seconds in RA but no delta for declination.  Apparently he made a 30 second error as NGC 3779 follows by +24 seconds in RA.  His description "E 90° [E-W]" seems to clinch the identification IC 717 = NGC 3779.

Andrew Common discovered NGC 3779 in 1860 with his 36" reflector.  With respect to NGC 3775, he noted "another 5' nf ".  Close to this offset is MCG -02-30-013 = PGC 36084.  Herbert Howe measured an accurate position, that was repeated in the IC 2 notes.

A mag 16.3 star is off the southeast side [27" from center].  An extremely faint "star" was noted off the northwest side [25" from center].  After later checking the SDSS, I discovered this is a compact galaxy (SDSS J114534.52+031417.8) with V = 17.8.  An extremely faint edge-on poking out of the east side of IC 730 was not seen.

17.5" (4/9/99): faint, small, slightly elongated SW-NE, 25" diameter, no concentration.  Visible steadily with direct vision.  A mag 15 star lies 1.6' SSW.  This is a Todd discovery and due to a poor position is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  This galaxy is listed as IC 730 (good position from Javelle) in modern catalogues.

Stephane Javelle found IC 730 = J. 2-728 on 22 Mar 1893 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory.  His position matches CGCG 040-040.  This galaxy was first discovered by David Todd on 11 Feb 1878 in his search for trans-Neptunian planets with the 26-inch refractor at the Naval Observatory and reported as Todd 10 (later NGC 3849).  Todd noted a "large and nebulous" object with a star 2' in PA ~210° (SSW).  There is nothing at his rough position, but using Todd's discovery sketch, Harold Corwin identified Todd 10 as CGCG 040-040.  So, IC 730 = NGC 3849.

Most modern catalogues label this galaxy as IC 730 due to the poor NGC position, though Deep Sky Field Guide and Uranometria Sky Atlas use NGC 3849.  See Harold Corwin's identification notes.

But the surface brightness is irregular or mottled with a very small, slightly brighter nucleus and an impression of spiral structure.  Forms a contrasting pair with IC 750 3.4' ESE.

Lewis Swift found IC 778 = Sw. VII-19 on 3 Apr 1888 and noted "eF, pS, R, bet 2 st in meridian [N-S], n. one = 13 mag."  There is nothing at his position.  It's possible IC 778 = MCG +09-20-146, though this galaxy is 10' north of Swift's position and 40 seconds of RA east, so off in both directions.  This galaxy lies between two stars, but they are oriented SW-NE, and not close to being "in meridian".  So, a third discrepancy.

But Harold Corwin found that if Swift made an error of exactly 5 minutes in RA (too large), then his position matches NGC 4198, which also is bracketed by two stars (oriented NNW-SSE).  The only question is why did Swift mention the "north one = 13 mag", when the southern star is the brighter one?  Still, this identification is more likely than MCG +09-20-146.

But 5' S of Swift's position is NGC 4813, which would have been nearby in Swift's wide field view, yet wasn't mentioned.  Corwin lists both galaxies as candidates but assigns the PGC as more likely due to the positional match.

Truman Safford found IC 843 = Sf. 3, along with IC 842, on 3 May 1866.  This galaxy was probably originally discovered by Lawrence Parsons, the 4th Earl of Rosse on 24 Apr 1865 and catalogued as NGC 4913.  On the same observation he discovered NGC 4912, NGC 4916 and IC 4088.  Parsons assumed he was observing the NGC 4914 field, but the discovery sketch that shows 4 nebulae (and one suspected neb) is a reasonably good match with a field 8° further south.  NGC 4913, labeled as Gamma in the diagram, matches IC 843.  Sue French originally suggested this identification.

Herbert Howe found NGC 4973 again on 29 Jun 1900 and included it in his 3rd list of new nebulae (#19), assuming NGC 4973 and 4974 were further east.  He stated in his notes that 3-19 was near IC 847, so Corwin concludes Howe probably misidentified NGC 4974 as IC 847.

His position is 2' SSE of LEDA 1633794 and 2' due south of his position for Sw. VIII-69 = IC 866.  But these two galaxies are actually separated by 2' due E-W, so clearly an error was made or only a single galaxy was actually observed.  In any case, Javelle independently discovered the group on 11 Jun 1891 (adding IC 869) and measured pretty accurate positions that were used in the IC.

Lewis Swift found IC 895 = Sw. VIII-75 on 1 Sep 1888 and reported "vF; pL; R; * in center ? D[ouble]."  There is nothing near his position.  The closest galaxy he might have picked up is NGC 5240, but his position is well off in RA (3 minutes 40 sec) and over 4' in declination.  Without finding a suitable candidate, Harold Corwin listed this number as lost.  But in August 2017, I noticed that if I added 10 minutes of RA to Swift's position, this landed just off the northeast edge of NGC 5273 (discovered by William Herschel), and Swift's description is a good match with his galaxy.  This assumes he missed nearby, but much fainter, NGC 5276.

When I contacted Corwin about this find, he noticed that the same 10 minutes of RA correction applied to IC 1028 and IC 1045, discovered on the same night!  This results in IC 1028 = NGC 5739 and IC 1045 = UGC 9559, instead of the identifications IC 1028 = UGC 9368 in modern catalogues 15' SE of Swift's position and IC 1045 = NGC 5731?, from Corwin.  Finally, Courtney Seligman found that IC 511, the 4th and last object discovered that night, shares the same 10 minute error (see that number).  So, due to the common error of all 4 objects, these new identifications are secure.

All modern sources (except for NED) misidentify IC 897 as UGC 8544, a thin edge-on located 10' SW.  Bigourdan, who discovered IC 897, unfortunately misidentified his offset star and when his offsets are applied to the star he noted, the position falls close to UGC 8544.  But when the correct offset star is used, the identification of IC 897 = CGCG 102-20 is matched.  This identification also agrees with his offsets for IC 897 from NGC 5217.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 897 = Big. 180 on 20 May 1890 and noted "Magnitude 13.5; situated from NGC 5217 at a PA of 105, Dist. = 3.5 arcmins."  His published position in Comptes Rendus (used by Dreyer in the IC) happens to fall near UGC 8544 = CGCG 102-016 and modern catalogues have taken this galaxy as IC 897.  Malcolm Thomson sorted out the correct identification (see "The True Identity of IC 897" in Deep Sky Observer #136) as well as Harold Corwin's identification notes.

See observing notes for NGC 5360.  Identification uncertain and probably should be classified as not found.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 958 = Sw. IX-39 on 19 Apr 1890 and reported "eeeF; pS; iR; seen only by glimpses."  His position is 3.5' NE of NGC 5360 and this is the favored identification by Harold Corwin.   There are two question marks about this identification; there is no mention of brighter NGC 5364 8' ENE, which would have been in the same field.  Also his description implies a marginally visible object and NGC 5360 should have been more evident to Swift.  Yann Pothier CGCG 046-033 = PGC 49845 could be Swift's object.  This would imply a 5.5 minute error in RA.  His argument is this galaxy is fainter than NGC 5360 (and more appropriate to be called "eeeF") and is isolated, as opposed to NGC 5360.  As an alternative, Yann suggests a faint double star 22 seconds of RA due west of Swift's position.  So, the identification has plenty of uncertainty in the identification of IC 958.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 973 = Big. 182, along with IC 974, on 21 May 1890 while search for Wilhelm Tempel's NGC 5467 and 5465.  According to Harold Corwin he confused the field and reported this single star (identical to Tempel's NGC 5467) as possibly nebulous.  Corwin notes that "he caught the identity later when he was preparing his complete observations for publication."  Assuming the same star fooled both Tempel and Bigourdan, this is the only known case where a single star has both an NGC and IC designation!  Bigourdan's IC 974 is another nearby star he thought to be nebulous.

18" (6/18/04): moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 or 5:3 ~N-S. Contains a small, brighter, roundish core and the extensions are a much lower surface brightness.  A mag 14 star is just 0.8' N of center. A striking equilateral triangle of mag 11-12 stars is close northeast with the nearest star 1' N of center.  IC 997 is an (unresolved) interacting pair with companion PGC 1057935 and the brightest of a trio with IC 4401 9' WSW and IC 998 5' ENE.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 997 = Sw (X)-4 = Sw XI-168, along with IC 998, on 16 May 1892 and recorded "vF; S; R; * with distant companion near north; p of 2 [with IC 998]." His description of a "* with distant companion near north" applies to the two stars immediately north of the interacting pair PGC 51220 and LEDA 1057935.  But Malcolm Thomson argues that IC 997 is identical to IC 4401 = PGC 51173 and IC 998 is PGC 51220 (the galaxy listed here), as these are the brightest two galaxies (of 4) in the region.  Harold Corwin comments, though, that the separations and descriptions are a better fit with IC 997 = PGC 51220 and IC 998 = LEDA 1058483, which is the faintest of the 4.

18" (6/18/04): faint, very small, round. The view is a bit confused by a very faint star which is close south (~20") so these objects could initially appear to be a faint, close double. The galaxy appeared only 10" or so in diameter. Barely visible with direct vision though only a faint stellar nucleus remained. Faintest of trio with IC 997 and IC 4401 and situated 5' ENE of IC 997.

This galaxy is the faintest of a quartet, but Swift's offset from IC 997 points directly to this galaxy.  Howe identified this galaxy as IC 998 when he observed the field carefull around 1900 and discovered IC 4401. But Malcolm Thomson argues against the identification listed here (PGC 1058483).

But in August 2017, I noticed that IC 895 likely had 10 minute error in RA, so that IC 895 = NGC 5273, and Harold Corwin followed this lead and found IC 1028 (as well as IC 1045), also discovered on 1 Sep 1888, shared the same 10 minute error in RA.  The corrected position lands on the north edge of NGC 5739, and this galaxy has a 14th magnitude star off the northeast edge, matching the description.

This is an unusual situation with a brighter IC galaxy (discovered by William Herschel) in the field of a fainter NGC galaxy (discovered by John Herschel).

William Herschel discovered IC 1029 = H II-696 = Big. 185 on 15 May 1787 (sweep 736) and recorded "pB, S, E."  His position matches UGC 9361.  This galaxy is the brighter of a pair of edge-ons with fainter UGC 9347 9.6' NW.  When JH observed the field, he picked up UGC 9347, measured the position accurately (mentioning the star at the edge), but assumed it was his father's II-696.  JH used his position for h1838 in the GC and Dreyer followed in the NGC (NGC 5673 = h1838, but not H II-696).

When Bigourdan observed the pair of galaxies on 14 Jun 1887, he assumed UGC 9361 was new, measured an accurate position, and Dreyer catalogued Big. 185 as IC 1029.

R.J. Mitchell discovered IC 1066 = J 1-324, along with IC 1067, on 16 May 1855 using LdR's 72".  He assumed he was observing the double system NGC 5765, but his description and sketch clearly refers to the IC pair.  He recorded "2 neb with 3 B st near, both F, bM.  The north one has a double star close sp, and is E np sf; the s one is perhaps also slightly E sp nf." ?A diagram in the 1880 publication is a perfect match with IC 1066 and IC 1067 (close northeast of a double star).  The pair of galaxies was found again on 3 May 1856 while searching for NGC 5775!  Dreyer realized that Mitchell's pair was different than NGC 5775, but without a position he wasn't able to include it in the NGC.

Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again on 28 May 1891, measured an accurate position, and it was catalogued as IC 1066.  Javelle is credited in the IC, as the connection with the Birr Castle sketch was never made.

CGCG 048-116, 2.0' E, is fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, 0.5'x0.4', fairly even surface brightness.  CGCG 048-117, 3.8' SE, is faint, small, round, stellar nucleus surrounded by an 0.3' halo.

17.5" (6/29/00): this is the brighter of close pair of difficult galaxies.  At 220x, it appeared as an extremely faint and small glow, perhaps 25" diameter.  At 280x a confused glow was visible and with extended viewing a close companion (UGC 9710) was just resolved to the southeast .  With concentration both members could almost be held continuously.  A mag 15 star lies 1.3' NE (this is IC 1088).

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1087 = J. 336, along with IC 1088, on 28 May 1891.  His reference for IC 1087 and IC 1088 was a mag 9-10 star at 15 07 02.6 +03 50 50 (2000).  His offsets for #336 = IC 1087 are -19.8 seconds of time and -4' 14.8" dec. This places IC 1087 at 15 06 42.8 +03 46 35 (J2000), a perfect match with the northwest galaxy of the pair.  IC 1088, though, refers to a mag 15 star 1.3' NE of IC 1088.  It is often misidentified as the southeast member of the pair.

UGC 9710 appeared extremely faint or very faint, fairly small, very low surface brightness streak, ~30"x5".  This galaxy is the fainter of a close pair with IC 1087 just 32" NW!

On 29 Jun 2000 I also viewed UGC 9710 in my 17.5" and recorded, "fainter of a very close pair with IC 1087 [33" between centers].  Glimpsed with averted vision only as a very small, elongated glow, ~20"x10" E-W.  It was difficult to hold IC 1087 and UGC 9710 simultaneously.

In any case all modern catalogues (MCG, CGCG, PGC, HyperLeda, SIMBAD, UGC Notes) misidentify CGCG 106-011 as IC 1096. Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin agree with this identification.

NGC identification uncertain (poor position from WH) and this galaxy is identified as IC 1100 (from Swift) in UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1100 = Sw. IX-45 on 22 Jun 1889 and logged "vF; pS; lE; bet 2 stars."  His position is 1.2' NW of UGC 9729.  This galaxy was probably discovered by William Herschel on 26 Apr 1789 (sweep 930) and noted H II-818 as "pF, cL, R, vgbM."  CH's reduced position is 52 sec of RA east and 2' south of UGC 9729.  Dreyer notes in the 1912 "Scientific Papers", that the listed RA in GC and NGC was 2 tmin too large (the actual error is ~ 2 min 45 sec).  Because of this error, Bigourdan and d'Arrest were unable to locate NGC 5881 and Swift assumed his rediscovery was new, though Dreyer noted in his "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" that "II-818 is probably = IC 1100."

UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 all label this galaxy as IC 1100 (because of the unambiguous position) instead of NGC 5881.  I wrote up this case in RNGC Corrections #6 and it is discussed in Corwin's notes.

18" (6/30/11): this supergiant cD galaxy is the central galaxy in AGC 2029 (z = .078 at 1 billion light years!).  At 280x, it appeared very faint, very small, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~15"x10".  Visible continuously with averted vision.  The galaxy is squeezed between a mag 14.7 star 27" E and a mag 15-15.5 star 47" WNW, just slightly south of a line connecting the two stars.  No other members of the cluster were seen.  Also viewed at a similar magnification in a 24" f/3.3 and logged as "faint, very small, round, oval 3:2 N-S, ~20"x14".  Could just hold steadily with direct vision."

Wikipedia states this galaxy is the largest known in the universe, from 5-6 million light years.  A 1991 paper by Uson, Boughn, & Kuhn (ApJ, 369, 46) gives a slightly smaller, though still extremely large diameter of 4 million light years.

Edward Swift, Lewis' 19 year-old son, discovered IC 1101 = Sw IX-47 on 19 Jun 1890.  Lewis noted that he and Edward disagreed on the description after the telescope was moved, and as a result no description is given in Swift's 9th discovery list.  In his survey of NGC/IC objects around 1900, Herbert Howe found it to be "extremely faint and very small.  A star of mag 13 follows 1.5 seconds...and another precedes 2 seconds, a little north."  UGC does not label their entry (UGC 9752) as IC 1101.

This is a super-giant cD in the center of AGC 2029 at a distance of 1.07 billion light years (slightly larger redshift than AGC 2065!).  IC 1101 is certainly one of the most distant galaxies discovered visually (and possibly the most distant)!

Williamina Fleming found IC 1108 on a photograph of stellar spectra at Harvard's Arequipa station and announced as a star with a spectra of the "fifth type" in 1894 (AN 3227, 195).  Later that year, she reported "this object is in reality a gaseous nebula".  This planetary was originally discovered by John Herschel on 27 Sep 1834 and catalogued as h3594 (later NGC 5882). The equivalence apparently went unannounced until Andris Lauberts (ESO) and Harold Corwin ran across it while scanning southern Schmidt plates.

There is nothing at his position but most sources, including HyperLeda and SIMBAD, identify UGC 9800 as IC 1111.  This galaxy is situated 14' ENE of Swift's position and there are no stars forming an obvious triangle.  Harold Corwin noticed that NGC 5876, located 5 minutes of RA west of Swift's position, has two mag 12-13 stars 2' NW and 3' SW forming a distinctive triangle and matching Swift's description.  Ironically, Swift made the original discovery on 11 Jun 1885. So, likely NGC 5876 = IC 1111.  See Harold Corwin's comments on IC 1111.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1124 = Sw. VIII-88 on 28 May 1889 and reported "eeF; vS; vE; 2 pB st. in field n."  His RA is 30 seconds too large but the description fits.  Stephane Javelle found the galaxy again and recorded J. 1367 as "pB, elongated in p.a. 250°, 30" to 40" length, mag 12-13 stellar nucleus." with an accurate position.  Dreyer realized that Javelle's object was the same as IC 1124 and noted this in the IC Notes/Corrections appendix, along with Javelle's accurate position.

Swift VIII,#88.  15hr 28m 21s +23° 49'.1
Confirmed galaxy: This is not an error in the context normally found and I enter it only for the historical significance. 
Javelle made an observation some 14 years after Swift and noted the presence of a nebula, (he numbered as J.1367), which he measured from the 7.3Mv star DM+24°2874 resulting in coordinates of 15hr 27m 49s +23° 48'.2 which are at quite some variance with those given by Swift as to RA.  However, when this object is examined on the Palomar print there can be no doubt that despite the very inaccurate Swift coordinates this is definitely Swift's object #88 as can be established by reference to his description in which he stated "eeF; vS; vE; 2 pB st. in field n," and the south following of these 2 stars is Javelle's DM+24°2874.

Dreyer obviously concluded that the Javelle observation was a duplicate as he not only equated the two observations (Notes and Corrections to the Index Catalogue 1888-1894.  NGC/IC page 377.), but he also has no reference to any identity for J.1367 in his IC II, however, he did employ Swift's coordinates which are in considerable error, fortunately the modern catalogues do not reflect this, rather their coordinates are in keeping with those given by Javelle.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1125 = J. 2-789 on 10 Jun 1893.  His position is on the northwest side of UGC 9888 and the identification is certain.

Harold Corwin suggests that IC 1128 (discovered by Lewis Swift on 28 May 1889) is probably IC 1125 with a 5 minute error in RA and a 5 arcmin error in declination.   The CGCG identifies CGCG 022-018 = UGC 9939 as IC 1128.  This galaxy is much closer to Swift's position (similar RA, but 12' to the north).  But this galaxy has a companion (CGCG 022-017) that Corwin feels that Swift would have also picked up.  Most modern sources (including HyperLeda) follow CGCG.

His position is close west of UGC 10108, which is surrounded by several stars, although a trapezoid of 4 stars is a better description.  Swift apparently found this object again on 16 Sep 1896 and reported it as new in his 11th discovery list, though the RA was 25 seconds too small.  The description mentions "in center of trapezium".  Howe measured an accurate position in 1900 and noted Swift's two entries were identical.  He described the surrounding stars as a rhomboid [trapezoid] and measured the separations and position angles.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1158 = Sw. X-33 on 7 July 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  While searching for Wolf's comet of 1884 he found a nebula described in his logbook as "vF, R, 1' dia, vgbM, an 8m star 22' exactly following."  His rough position (no offsets) and the description clearly applies to this galaxy.   Barnard found it again less than a month later (4 Aug), looking for d'Arrest's Comet!   Lewis Swift made an independent discovery on 17 July and reported the discovery in his 10th list. Barnard never published the discovery or informed Dreyer, so Swift is credited with the discovery in the IC.

His position is a good match with NGC 6056, which Swift had discovered exactly two years earlier!

Although this galaxy lies between 2 stars, that statement can be made to apply to most galaxies.

There was a very weak central brightening and a very faint nucleus.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1179 = Sw VII-71 on 3 Jun 1888 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R.  11th of 12."  His position falls very close to the double system NGC 6050 = Arp 272.  PGC, SIMBAD and HyperLeda assign IC 1179 to the much fainter southwest component, but Corwin, Malcolm Thomson and I doubt that Swift could have resolved the pair.  Additionally Swift described NGC 6050(A) as "eeeF" (at his limit) but NGC 6050B is much fainter, and he makes no mention of the nebula being double!  So, almost certainly IC 1179 = NGC 6050.

IC 1194A is located at Javelle's position for IC 1194, not the brighter galaxy 80" S (described above) that is generally assumed to be IC 1194.  It's possible Javelle assumed the brighter galaxy was a star, though it was clearly nonstellar in my scope at 282x.  IC 1194A appeared faint to fairly faint, very small, round, 12" diameter.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 1194 = J. 1-377, along with IC 1192 and 1193, on 13 Aug 1892.  His position is a good match with the fainter lenticular 1.4' NE of IC 1192, which is commonly identified as IC 1194A = PGC 84742.  His position is also 1' north of the brighter elliptical (CGCG 108-152 = PGC 57172), which is described in my notes. CGCG 108-152 is identified as IC 1194 in most modern sources.  Perhaps Javelle made a 1' error in measuring the offset from his comparison star?  Interestingly, his offset is 1' too far north for nearby IC 1193 adding some support to this suggestion.

Corwin comments that "Perhaps he mistook the brighter object as a star, though it should have been clearly nebulous in the Nice 28-inch."  Malcolm Thomson and Corwin both identify IC 1194 = PGC 84742 based on the positional match, though the data here is for CGCG 108-152 as I'm not convinced.

Situated in the exact center of an isosceles triangle of 3 mag 11 stars 2.8' NNW, 2.9' SSW and 3.2' ESE.  The latter galaxy was actually discovered by E.E.

24" (8/5/13): fairly faint, fairly small, round.  Well concentrated with a 15" bright core that gradually increases to an occasional very faint stellar nucleus.  The core is surrounded by a thin low surface brightness halo ~24" diameter.  Situated 12.5' ENE of mag 7.7 HD 148591.  CGCG 052-028 lies 5.5' SW.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1220 = Sw. X-34 on 18 May 1890 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He simply noted "pF, S", but his offsets from mag 7.7 HD 148591 of +50 seconds in RA and ~+2.8' in Dec point directly to this galaxy.  Lewis Swift independently discovered this it just 2 months later on 21 Jul 1890 and recorded "eeF; pS; E."  His position is 15 seconds of RA too small, though the IC position is off by an additional 10 seconds of RA.  Swift is credited with the discovery in the IC as Barnard never published his discovery or informed Dreyer.  CGCG (052-030) and MCG (+01-42-005) don't label their catalogue entries as IC 1220.

24" (7/21/17): at 375x; faint, extremely small, round, 8"-10" diameter.  I could easily hold this faint galaxy continuously with averted (V = 15.1) as the surface brightness is moderately high.  Located 7.3' W of NGC 6338 in a compact galaxy group.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1250 = Sw. IX-77 on 23 Jun 1890 and reported "pF; S; cE."  His position is within 30" of LEDA 2565010, though I have concerns about this identification as his description doesn't seem appropriate. LEDA 2565010 is quite faint (V ~15), so I would expect Swift to have called it “eeF” or “eeeF”, instead of “pF”. Also visually only the 12" core was seen, yet his description says “cE". ?The same night he discovered IC 1237, which he called “eF”. Yet IC 1237 appeared much brighter visually (at least a magnitude) than IC 1250. ?But I don’t see another good candidate for the identification of IC 1250, unless his observation refers to NGC 6338, which is roughly a minute of RA east. Harold Corwin agrees with my brightness and elongation discrepancies and is placing colons (uncertainty) on the position in his IC table.

Rudolph Spitaler discovered IC 1257 on 7 July 1890 while searching for Barnard's Comet C/1888 RI using the 27" refractor at Wien University Observatory in Austria.  His micrometric position is accurate.  Barnard himself, also discovered it the next night, while searching for the same comet with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  Barnard initially mistook it for the comet!

Harlow Shapley listed IC 1257 as an open cluster (1930) and Sven Cederblad as a nebula (1946).  Brian Skiff reports in 9/96: Barry Madore to take a handful of short exposures of it at the Palomar 200", and has run through a first-cut data reduction.  The color-magnitude diagram shows that it is unquestionably a globular cluster, which is moderately heavily reddened:  it has the telltale marks of a metal-poor halo cluster, which are (a) a blue horizontal-branch population and (b) a steep red-giant branch.

17.5" (6/14/96): brightest mag 7.5 star at the east end of M8 illuminating a bright 2' halo of nebulosity.  This star is symmetrically placed on the following side of the cluster with respect to the two mag 7.5 stars on the west side of the Lagoon.

17.5" (6/8/96): this is the mag 7.5 star (SAO 186247) embedded in the southeast portion of the Lagoon nebula, which is surrounded by a locally brighter halo of nebulosity at all powers.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1271 = Sw VIII-94 on 5 Aug 1888 and recorded "eeeF, vL, N6523 nr p, ee diff; B* inv or is a neb *; discovered 2 years ago."  His position is about 5' southeast of a mag 7 star at 18 05 10.6 -24 23 55 which is embedded in the eastern wing or extension of the Lagoon nebula.  Corwin notes that John Herschel discovered and sketched this extension and considered it part of the M8 complex.

Dreyer states in his 1912 update of WH's catalogues that IC 1271 is identical to NGC 6526 = H V-9  (also part of M8). See Corwin's identification notes on NGC 6526.

24" (9/7/13): at 200x appeared as a fairly faint to moderately bright, roundish glow, ~3' diameter, with a weak concentration.  Grows in size with averted vision to at least 3.5' diameter.  At 375x, a total of 8-10 stars were resolved with a couple of additional stars occasionally popping.  The brightest is a mag 13-13.5 star on the west side with a mag 14 star 35" E.  A few additional stars appear to be ~15-15.5 magnitude with the remainder closer to 16th magnitude.  A mag 10.6 star is 3' NNE of center.

18" (6/22/09): at 225x appeared as a faint, moderately large, roundish glow with no central concentration.  A string of three stars are superimposed on the north side of the cluster.

17.5" (8/2/97): at 220x, this globular appears as an obvious irregular glow of ~3' diameter with a mag 13.5 star at the west edge.  A superimposed mag 14 star follows [by 36"] and a third mag 14.5 on a line is at the east end.  A mag 15 star was also glimpsed along this string close following the mag 14 star. Appears elongated ~E-W and the irregular outline increases in size with averted vision to 4'x3'.  This faint globular has an unusual mottled patchy appearance although the observed stars may be field stars.

17.5" (7/27/95): at 220x appears faint, moderately large, 3' irregular scraggly outline.  No resolution although has an irregular surface brightness.  There is a mag 13 star at the west end, closely followed by a mag 14.5 star.  A similar faint star is situated at the east end.  Located 3' SSW of a mag 11 star.

17.5" (7/4/86): at 105x appears as a faint glow with no central condensation.  Two stars mag 13-14 are on the west side.  At 286x the cluster seems to extend mostly east of the following of the two stars.  Located 3' SSW of a mag 11 star.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1276 = Sw VIII-95 on 10 Apr 1889 and recorded "eeeF; vL; ee diff; D* close to p edge; very wide D* nr north."  George Abell found it again in 1952 on the POSS (published in the 1955 paper "Globular Clusters and Planetary Nebulae Discovered on the National Geographic Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey") and missed the equivalence with globular #7, but IC 1276 = Palomar 7.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1279 = Sw. VII-95 on 18 Oct 1887 and recorded "eeeF; pS; R; in a semicircle of st.; eee diff."  His position is 2.5' NW of UGC 11143 = PGC 61518 with the semicircle of stars mostly to the east.  He "discovered" this galaxy a second time on 28 May 1889 and recorded Sw. VIII-96 (later IC 1281) as "eeF S; cE; semicircle of several stars near following."  His published RA was 21 seconds too large, but again the description applies.  Dreyer catalogued the second observation as IC 1281, but queried "? = 1279".  Howe took a look at the field with the 20" refractor at Denver in 1899 and reported "I see only one nebula in the vicinity and call it 'vF, pS."

But Swift's second position happens to fall close to CGCG 200-010 = PGC 61527, a close pair of extremely small and faint galaxies, and Zwicky and Herzog identified this pair as IC 1279 in the CGCG (Volume III).  But Swift's description doesn't match this close pair as the "semicircle of several stars" is preceding (west), not following the pair.  PGC, as well as all online databases (NED, HyperLeda, SIMBAD) repeat the CGCG misidentification.  Harold Corwin recovered the identification IC 1279 = IC 1281 (first given by Dreyer in the IC 2 Notes).  See his notes.

Harold Corwin concludes that IC 1281 is more likely a duplicate of IC 1279, discovered earlier by Swift on 18 Oct 1887.  Swift's RA for IC 1281 is 21 seconds too large, but his description applies.  Dreyer originally suggested the equivalence because Howe took a look at the field with the 20" refractor at Denver in 1899 and reported "I see only one nebula in the vicinity and call it 'vF, pS."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1283 on the photographic plate taken with the 6" Willard in Jun 1892.  He commented that BD -19° 4948 is nebulous and "the nebulosity is very small and principally noticeable on the southern side of the [9.3 magnitude] star."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1284 on a photographic plate taken with the 6" Willard lends on 31 May 1892.  He noted "an unknown nebulous star [BD -19° 4953].  It is shown on the photograph to be nearly symmetrically surrounded with a faint diffused nebulosity about 15' in diameter.  Perhaps this nebulosity is a little denser and more extensive following.  Visually with the 12 inch, I cannot be certain of seeing the nebulosity on account of the brightness of the central star." He later described nearby IC 1283 in AN 3111.

18" (8/12/07): this was a difficult observation to confirm as this large, very faint reflection nebula is illuminated by mag 5.7 HD 170740 (unequal double ∑2325 = 5.9/9.2 at 12") and the bright star naturally has some surrounding scattered light.  Adding a wide bandpass Deep Sky filter the glow definitely brightened and increased in size.  The contrast improvement was easy to see by blinking with the filter.  It was difficult to estimate a size as the haze faded into the background, but appeared ~15'-20' in size.  Open cluster NGC 6649 lies 38' NE.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1287 on a plate taken with the 12" Willard lens on 29 Jun 1892.  He noted (AN 3111) "the 5.5 mag star BD -10° 4713 is shown to be nebulous.

24" (8/12/15): excellent view at 220x, using a UHC filter.  The rim is clearly brighter, particularly along the south side.  The west side of the planetary is clearly weaker with a darker indentation, creating a "C" appearance, open to the west. A very faint, fairly thin outer shell is visible with careful viewing.  This shell is roughly the thickness of the brighter rim.  At 375x (unfiltered), 8 or 9 stars are superimposed, including several around or just off the edge.  The stellar planetary K 4-8 lies just 4.7' NW in the same high power field and NGC 6712 is 24' WNW in the same low power field.

K4-8 was easily visible unfiltered as a mag 14.5 "star", the middle of 5 stars in a shallow 51" arc, concave to the northwest. Excellent contrast gain adding a UHC filter at 220x, so it was very easy to identify.

33" (9/16/07): at 200x appeared weakly annular with a slightly darker hole in the center and slightly brighter rim except on the west edge where there was an indentation or darker notch taking a small bite out of the rim.

18" (7/22/06): at 220x and UHC filter this fairly bright, large planetary was crisp-edged, slightly elongated ~E-W, ~1.5x1.3' in size.  The rim appeared slightly brighter, particularly along the south side giving a weak impression of annularity.  Several stars bracket the planetary and four or five mag 14-15.5 stars appear within the disc at 325x without a filter.  I viewed this object along with NGC 6712 and the stellar planetary K 4-8 in the same low power field of view!

17.5" (6/30/00): fairly bright at 220x using a UHC filter as a roundish disc, ~1.6'x1.4'.  The surface brightness is irregular and it appears slightly brighter along the southwest and northwest portion of the rim.  The unfiltered view at 280x also reveals a mottled appearance with a mag 13.5-14 star situated right at the west edge and a mag 14.5 star in the interior (a bit offset from center).  A couple of extremely faint stars are at the following edge. Located 24' ESE of NGC 6712.

17.5" (7/12/86): bright, large, round, 1.5' diameter.  Very pretty at 220x, estimate V = 12.0-12.5.  The stellar planetary K 4-8 is just 4.6' WNW.

13" (7/27/84): the rim on the south or SW side appears brighter but no definite annularity was seen.

13.1" (8/15/82): fairly faint, appears slightly elongated in an E-W orientation.

At 488x it appeared fairly faint, fairly small, 40" diameter with a round, very small bright nucleus.  Surprisingly, two faint, spiral arms were just visible extending from the nucleus!  A brighter arm is attached at the south side and winds counterclockwise towards the southwest.  It was often visible with averted vision.  The fainter arm on the north side curving northeast required more effort and was only occasionally visible but confirmed.  A mag 13.8 star is close preceding (26" W of center).

17.5" (7/5/86): extremely faint, small, round, very low surface brightness.  This difficult galaxy is situated just 4' NW of M57!  Located along the north side of a small rhombus of mag 13-14 stars with sides of 1.5'.  IC 1296 is just 30" ESE of a mag 14 star.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1296 visually on 2 Oct 1893 with the Lick 36-inch refractor.  His description in AN 3200 reads "this nebula is about 1/2' diameter.  Not round.  A little brighter in the middle.  About 14th magnitude." His position matches this faint spiral, located just 4' NW of M57.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1301 = Sw. IX-93 on 15 Apr 1890 and recorded "eeF; vS; R; 2 B and 1 F * in line nr f, nearest * nf close D with 300."  There is nothing near his position, though it is about 30' due south of UGC 11437.  Herbert Howe commented that he "searched for these [IC 1300 and 1301] in vain" on two nights.  Howe contacted Swift, who responded with a corrected declination of IC 1301 placing it 35' further north.  This places IC 1301 7' N of UGC 11438 = CGCG 256-018, which CGCG, RC3 and Malcolm Thomson identify as IC 1301.  But this galaxy does not match Swift's description of the nearby bright stars.  Harold Corwin notes that 15' N of the corrected position is IC 4867, found visually by Burnham on 21 Jun 1901 while measuring O∑ 182, and this galaxy matches Swift's descripption, so is a much more likely candidate.

48" (5/16/12): bright, fairly small, irregularly round.  At ~30", this HII knot is slightly larger than Hubble V and more uniform in surface brightness but the brighter portions of Hubble V have a higher surface brightness.  This is the easternmost of four HII knots along the northern side of Barnard's Galaxy.

18" (7/12/10): easily visible unfiltered at 225x and stands out fairly well at 285x as a 25" knot (irregularly round). Situated 1.7' NW of a mag 12/14 double star at ~8" separation.  This is the slightly fainter of a similar pair of HII knots at the north end of NGC 6822 with Hubble V just 3' W.

17.5" (9/1/02): following of two HII regions at the north end of Barnard's galaxy. Easily visible with averted vision at 220x without a filter and there is mild contrast gain using an OIII filter at 140x.

17.5" (7/14/99): following of a pair of HII regions with Hubble V at the north end of NGC 6822 = Barnard's Galaxy. Visible with direct vision at 220x and 280x without a filter. There was a mild contrast gain using a UHC filter at these magnifications.

17.5" (8/21/98): easily visible at 220x without a filter as a 30" round knot along with Hubble V just 3.1' W. Because I had no problem viewing this HII region without filtration I didn't blink or use an OIII filter.

17.5" (5/10/91): HII region on the NE edge of NGC 6822. At 82x and OIII filter appears as a faint, very small but clearly nebulous round knot. Estimate mag 14. A mag 12 star lies 2' SE (very close double on the POSS). Not seen without a filter. Forms a pair with similar Hubble V just 3' W.

Francis Leavenworth discovered IC 1308 = LM(S) 791 on 18 Jun 1887 with the 26-inch refractor at the Leander McCormick observatory.  Leavenworth missed seeing the galaxy but picked up the two bright HII regions at the north end of the galaxy instead.  Apparently, NGC 6822 was assumed to be the HII region Hubble V close preceding IC 1308 (Leavenworth credited both objects to Barnard) as the IC description for 1308 reads "eF, eS, lE, gbM, 6822 p 12s" (which actually refers to Hubble V).  E.E. Barnard independently discovered the two HII regions on 7 Jul 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.

Although the IC position matches this HII region and Howe also reobserved it and noted the double star close SE, Paul Hodge didn't label it as IC 1308 in "The HII regions of NGC 6822", P.A.S.P. 100:917-934, Aug 1988 or in "A Catalogue of diffuse nebula and emission-line stars in NGC 6822", 94:444-452, June 1982.  But Hubble's seminal 1925 paper on NGC 6822 (http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/full/1925ApJ....62..409H), mentions nebula X is identical to IC 1308.

17.5" (8/2/97): picked up at 100x as a small nebulous patch in a rich Milky Way field surrounding a mag 13 star.  It didn't stand out well at this power due to the rich environment but the glow had a noticeably higher surface brightness than the unresolved Milky Way glow.  The view was improved at 220x; a faint sprinkling of stars are superimposed (8-10 with averted vision) and the 2' cluster has an irregular outline.  Appears similar to a partially resolved globular.  A nice mag 12/13 double star [9" separation] is off the NE end 1.5' from center.  The view holds up well at 410x and one or two additional faint stars were resolved.

Thomas Espin discovered IC 1310 on 19 Sep 1893 with his 17-inch reflector at his private observatory in England while sweeping for red stars.  He simply recorded "faint nebulosity"  Very close to his position is this faint cluster, which was independently catalogued as Berkeley 50.

IC 1318 = Gamma Cyg Nebula = Butterfly Nebula = LBN 223/234/245/251 = Ced 176 = Sh 2-108
20 22 14 +40 15 24

18" (7/13/07): Both portions of the "Butterfly Nebula" were easily visible at 12.5x in my 80mm finder using an H-beta filter and were an amazing sight in the 18-inch at 73x using both H-beta and UHC filters as they stretched across the entire 67' field of field and separated by a wide dark lane (LDN 889).

IC 1318d (centered ~1° east of Gamma Cyg) passes through two 7th magnitude stars (HD 194789 and HD 194908) and is very prominent near these stars.  This swath of nebulosity courses mainly SW and NE from these stars.  To the west of the bright stars, the nebula is bifurcated into two forks by a dark lane.  To the north and NE of the stars, the nebulosity spreads out wider and is interspersed with darker regions.  Overall the surface brightness of this section is fairly high but varies quite a bit in intensity and is slightly brighter on the following side of the NE end where it contrasts with the wide dust lane that separates IC 1318e to the SE.

IC 1318e is situated roughly 35' SE of IC 1318d on the opposite side of dark nebula LDN 889.  This bright section passes through several wide double stars and gently curves as it sweeps from SW to NE.  The overall length is at least 35'x10' (not as wide as on photographs but nearly as long).  One or two darker spots or regions lie within the nebulosity although it appears as a single continuous piece without as much structure as IC 1318d.

IC 1318b is possibly the brightest piece of the IC 1318 complex and is located ~2° NW of Gamma Cyg (Sadr).  At 73x and either H-beta or UHC filter, it appeared very extended SW-NE or WSW-ENE, roughly 40'x8' and passes through a mag 8 star.  This section was easily visible at 12.5x in the 80mm finder using a H-beta filter.  The brightest portion is to the NE of the mag 8 star and a number of similar mag stars are involved with this portion.  Removing the filter, this section was still visible though the highest contrast was using a UHC filter.  To the SW of the star, this river of nebulosity takes a mild bend and flows more towards the south.  Another fainter section of nebulosity (not included in the size estimate) spreads out to the NNW of the mag 8 star.

12.5x80mm (7/13/07): viewed in 80mm finder using an H-beta filter.  The two roughly parallel brightest sections to the east of Gamma that form the "Butterfly Nebula" (IC 1318d and 1318e) were obvious as extremely large parallel strips oriented ~SW-NE and separated by a wide dark lane.

16x80 (8/23/84): extremely large complex of irregular emission nebulae surrounded Gamma Cygni (position given) with six sections visible at 16x using a UHC and H-beta filters.  Overfills the 4° finder field!  The most prominent section is an isolated patch NW of Gamma at the edge of the field (IC 1318b = Ced 176c = LBN 251 = DWB 82) and next are two parallel strips just east (IC 1318d = LBN 249) and SE of Gamma (IC 1318e = LBN 245) that have fairly sharp edges.  Observation from Mt Rose (above Lake Tahoe) using the finder.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1318 on a photographic plate taken with the Willard lens in 1892.  He noted "a photograph which I have made in 1892 with five hours of exposure was Chi Cygni, shows Gamma Cygni to be surrounded by numerous large patches and strips of nebulosity."

17.5" (8/22/98): the "Elephant's Trunk" is an unusual cometary globule (associated with star formation) on the west side of IC 1396, a huge but faint HII complex. The highest contrast was using a UHC filter at 100x.  A 15'x5' lane was evident oriented WSW-ENE, particularly by gently rocking the scope back and forth. The "tail" of the globule or elephant's "trunk" heads west and is weakly illuminated on the edges, particularly on the south side.  Near the "head" is a mag 9 star (HD 239710) and a pretty double star (∑2813 = 9.2/9.6 at 10") to the west is embedded in the lane.  With careful viewing the "trunk" shows variations in width and opacity.  Located ~18' W of the triple star ∑2816 (5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12"/20").

17.5" (8/12/96): This HII region is most prominent with a UHC filter at 100x surrounding the triple star (∑2816 = 5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12" and 20") at the center of a scattered cluster although nebulosity is not apparent throughout the field.  About 25' away is also a pretty double star whose components are aligned with the triple star.  The surrounding 1° field contains a scattered cluster of brighter stars which are fairly uniformly distributed.

In the 16x80 finder without a filter, the entire cluster is clearly encased in a faint glow at least two degrees in diameter though seems to be more prominent along the curving lanes of the cluster.  The Daystar 300 filter gives a mild enhancement but dims the stars so the overall view is not as pleasing.  Mu Cephei (Herschel's Garnet Star) is at the northeast edge, ~1.5° from the center.

18" (7/11/10): Barnard 161 is an easy 6' circular dark patch within IC 1396 (north of center) just 13' N of ∑2819 = 7.4/8.7 at 13" and 25' NE of the triple star ∑2816 = 5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12" and 20".  Stands out fairly well at 73x.  There are extensions to the north of this cometary dark nebula that I didn't see.

16x80 (9/29/84 and 8/26/89): using a UHC filter appears as a very large, irregular nebulous glow (about 2° diameter).  Very faint but definite when compared without filter.  Surrounds ∑2816 = 5.8/7.7 at 12" and a large, faint, scattered star group.  Visible without a filter as an extremely large, hazy region surrounding ∑2816 and fainter stars.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1396 on a photographic plate taken with the Willard lens in 1893.  He commented in "Photographic Nebulosities and Star Clusters connected with the Milky Way" (Astr. & Astro-Phys. 13, 177-182 (1894)) that "A magnificent specimen of these [nebulous masses] I have found on one of my plates in Cepheus which was given an exposure of seven hours.  This a mixture of bright stars and nebulosity.  The diffused portion of this nebulosity conforms in its peculiarities with the general structure of the Milky Way, showing it be actually mixed up with the ground work of star.  The brightest star of this group is DM +56° 2617."

24" (10/1/16): at 260x; with direct vision a sharp mag 14.5-14.8 "star" is easily visible.  But averted vision revealed the sharp stellar nucleus of this galaxy is surrounded by a very small halo, ~6"-8" diameter.  The halo was not difficult to pick out with averted once noticed.  IC 1452 forms a close pair (less than 1' NNW) with NGC 7374.

24" (7/29/16): at 260x; faint, virtually stellar (uncertain if a star).  IC 1452 forms a double system with NGC 7374 [centers separated by 56"].  Apparently I only viewed the stellar nucleus of this galaxy.

17.5" (8/20/88): very faint, extremely small, round.  Forms a double system with NGC 7374 57" SSE.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 1452 = B. 235 on 10 Oct 1890.  Both Malcolm Thomson and Harold Corwin noticed a six-degree error in the IC polar distance compared to Bigourdan's original position (1860 coordinations) in his 5th Comptes Rendus list.  Once corrected, his position matches CGCG 430-005 = PGC 69675. The CGCG, MCG, PGC, SIMBAD and HyperLeda (and secondary sources) don't label this galaxy as IC 1452.  The RNGC identifies this galaxy as NGC 7374B.

24" (10/3/13): at 225x using an NPB filter, IC 1454 (Abell 81) appeared fairly bright, round, 30" diameter, crisp-edged.  The planetary has a relatively large, brighter rim that is unevenly lit, and a small (~12"), slightly darker center.  Unfiltered the annularity is more difficult to confirm, though the rim appears slightly brighter on the south side.  A pair of 14th magnitude stars are just off the NE side and a mag 13.4 star is 1' SE.  Situated 4.3' W of mag 7 HD 215867.

18" (10/13/07): easily swept up at 175x, located 4' W of mag 7.0 HD 215867.  Compared views unfiltered and with UHC, OIII and NPB filters.  Best seen using OIII, though NPB gave the most natural view with brighter stars. Two faint mag 14/15 stars are very near the NE edge (brighter star barely off edge) with a brighter mag 13 star 1' SE.  At 225x using the NPB filter, IC 1454 appeared round, ~25-30" in diameter with an impression of an irregular surface brightness.  The rim sometimes appeared slightly brighter with a weaker center giving a very subtle annularity.

18" (10/9/04): easily picked up at 73x just 4' WNW of a 7th magnitude star as a small, well-defined disc.  Visible unfiltered at 160x; a couple of mag 14/15 stars are barely off the NE edge of the planetary and a 13th magnitude star lies 1' SE.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  The disc is perfectly round, ~25" diameter with a very crisp edge.  The surface brightness appeared a bit irregular but could not verify annularity at this power.

17.5" (10/13/01): picked up at 100x without filter as a faint, small disc situated 4' WNW of a mag 7 star.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears as a round, 25" crisp-edged disc.  At 220x without filter a faint mag 14/15 pair is at the NE edge.  Very nice view using a UHC filter at 140x-220x; the PN is slightly elongated ~E-W but no other details are visible.

17.5" (8/8/91): moderately bright, fairly small, almost round, slightly elongated E-W, 30" diameter.  A faint double star mag 14/15 is at the NE edge.  Located 3.8' WNW of mag 7 SAO 3785.  No central star visible.  Pretty planetary at 220x without filter.

13" (8/11/85): at 88x and OIII filter, fairly faint, fairly small, round.  Located 4' W of a mag 7 star that detracts from viewing.  At 166x with a UHC filter; easy to view, moderately large.  Two very faint stars are involved near the NE edge.

William Denning discovered IC 1454 on 9 Aug 1891 with his 10-inch reflector (announced in Observatory, 15, 104).  He noted it was "rather a difficult object, except on a good night, though I picked it up with a power of only 40.  It is noteworthy as being situated in the midst of a region containing very few nebulae."  IC 1454 was rediscovered by Abell in 1955 on the POSS, assumed to be new, and recatalogued as Abell 81.

The halo is quite extensive with averted vision and the dimensions are ~3.5'x3.0'.  Situated between a mag 11 star 3' WNW and a mag 12 star a similar distance following.  Brightest in a group including IC 5264 just 6' SSW.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1459 on 13 Dec 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He found it while searching for Brorsen's Comet (5D/Brorsen), along with several other NGC galaxies.  Barnard noted "small, cometary, bright with nucleus 12m, 1/2' dia."  His position is off the northeast edge of the galaxy (10 seconds too large in RA and 2' too far north).  A second position computed the next night is just 40" south of center.

Lewis Swift independently discovered the galaxy on 10 Jun 1896 and described Sw XI-220 as "B, cL, R, betw 2 stars p and f; nf of 2 [with IC 5264].  His position is 25 seconds of RA too large and 4' too far south, but the identification is certain.  So, IC 1459 = IC 5265.  Corwin notes that Dreyer questioned if IC 5265 might be identical to NGC 7418, but it's not.

18" (9/24/05): small, high surface brightness elongated glow extending from an 11th magnitude star.  At 115x, the nebulosity was not noticeably enhanced with an OIII filter but the UHC filter improved the contrast.  Easily takes 225x and the oval nebula appears to hang to the south-southeast of the bright star. A faint, close, equal mag double (STI 1138 = 12.7/12.7 at 4.6") lies 2' west.  A fairly striking, uncatalogued 5'x4' ring of stars follows by 9'.  The NW star in the ring (QT Cep) is encased in a faint glow (BFS 17).

A close, faint double star lies 1.9' W.  Several extremely faint stars are nearby, including one just off the SE edge and one close NE.

17.5" (10/30/99): picked up at 100x using an OIII filter as a small, bright glow surrounding a mag 12 star.  Best view at 280x unfiltered.  The involved star is attached at the north edge and the 1' oval nebula appears to hang off the south side of the star.  Close west is a very close, evenly matched faint double star!

13" (9/22/84): appears as a mag 12 star with a faint but easily visible oval nebula surrounding the star.  Extends mainly SE with the 12th magnitude star at the tip.  Visible without a filter.  Similar to Hubble's Variable Nebula.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1505 = Sw X-57 on 12 Nov 1891 and recorded "eeeF, pS, R, 3 pB stars following and 4 or 5 stars preceding, ee dif."  His position is 13 seconds of time preceding MCG -01-60-020 = PGC 72133, but a good match in declination.  Herbert Howe provided an accurate position in 1888-89 (repeated in the IC 2 Notes).

Johann Palisa found IC 1514 on 19 Sep 1893 with the 27" refractor at Vienna and noted "vF, 1/3' diameter, slightly eccentric nucleus."  His position matches MCG -02-60-022 = PGC 72812.  This galaxy was discovered by Ormond Stone on 31 Oct 1885 at Leander McCormick Observatory and reported in list I-270 (later NGC 7776).  Although there is nothing at his rough position (nearest min of RA), but Harold Corwin examined his field sketch and found it matches MCG -02-60-022.  So, IC 1514 = NGC 7776.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1516 = Sw X-59 on 14 Nov 1889 while searching for Brooks' Comet with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted "S, R, gbM, slightly cometary" and measured offsets of -0m 20.55s (mean of 5 measures) and +0' 53" from his comparison star, which is apparently mag 9 HD 224265.  IC 1516 is within a few arcseconds of these offsets.  He didn't publish the discovery, though, or notify Dreyer.

Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy on 12 Nov 1891 and described it as "vF, pS, R, B * sf, nf of 2 [with IC 1515]."  Swift was credited with the discovery in the IC.

Truman Safford discovered IC 1524 = Sf 87 on 23 Sep 1867.  His published discovery list in 1887 is missing his description and there is nothing at his position.  But 20 seconds of RA west and 1.6' north is MCG -01-01-011 = PGC 73151, the brighter of a north-south pair of galaxies.  Lewis Swift independently found IC 1524 on 5 Nov 1891 and recorded Sw X-52 (later IC 1490) as "eF; pS; R; vF * close N; 6 pB = Mag stars p[receding]."  There is nothing near Swift's position, but Harold Corwin found that Swift made an error of 30 minutes of time (too small) in recording his RA.  Once corrected, his RA is just 9 seconds too small and the dec matches perfectly, as well as his description of the nearby stars.  So, IC 1524 = IC 1490.

Aaron Skinner, assistant to Truman Safford at the Dearborn Observatory, discovered IC 1528 = Sf 88 on 23 Sep 1867 with the 18.5-inch refractor. The position published in the Dearborn discovery list (published in 1887) is 1.5' S of MCG -01-01-028 = PGC 312 (accurate in RA) and the identification is certain.  Dreyer copied the position into the NGC appendix list, but he made an error of 4° in North Polar Distance in the IC position.

Lewis Swift found IC 1530 = Sw XI-2 on 23 Sep 1897 and reported "eeeF; vL; eE; close f NGC 55; f of 2 [with NGC 55]."  He included a long note at the end of his discovery list: "This with its associated companion is a remarkable nebula.  I am undecided as to whether it is all one, or consisting of two, the preceding half very very bright, very larg, exceedingly elongated as Sir John Herschel describes it, and the following half exceedingly exceedingly faint, very large, exceedingly elongated, partly overlapping the other.  If single it is curved, if double are inclined to each other.  I am included to think they are two distinct nebulae, one reason being that the brighter ends sharply, which would be improbably if the brighter merged into the fainter.  The brighter was discovered by Dunlop, but he could not have seen the fainter.  As Sir John Herschel does not mention with a sign as being a remarkable object, lends plausibility to the idea that it was not seen even by him."

But Dunlop's size estimate of 25' includes the faint eastern portion and JH's sketch of NGC 55 clearly shows the fainter eastern section!  Corwin's position is centered on the brightest portion of the eastern half.

24" (9/30/16): at 200x; fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, ~15"x12", faint stellar nucleus.  Forms the southern component of a disrupted, contact pair (Arp 282) with NGC 169 [21" between centers].  Located 3.8' SW of distracting mag 6.2 HD 3411!  NGC 160 lies 11' WSW.

13.1" (10/20/84): appears as a "faint star" possibly nebulous at the south edge of NGC 169, forming a close contact system (Arp 282).

R.J. Mitchell discovered IC 1559 = Big. 245 = J 3-819 on 18 Sep 1857 using LdR's 72" and described NGC 160 as "S; d. neb; the n one is E, sp/nf; bM."  IC 1559 is the fainter southern component.  It was confirmed a month later on 22 Oct 1857 and reobserved by Lawrence Parsons in 1866.  JH interpreted Mitchell's observation as implying NGC 160 was double and included the "nova" as GC 80.  But comparing the description to the field, it's clear that Mitchell was referring to NGC 169 and its close companion to the south, which later received the designation IC 1559.

Herman Schultz observed the field on 5 Sep 1867 (9.6" refractor) and also suspected NGC 169 to be double ("is probably S globular, and seems sometimes to be divided into two separate objects.").  In the 1880 publication Dreyer notes that Mitchell mistook his object for h32 = NGC 160, but the "double nebula" should apply to h82 = NGC 169.

Because of all the confusion Dreyer dropped GC 80 from the GC Supplement and added GC 5107 (which became NGC 162) to a faint star east-northeast of NGC 160 that Schultz and Lawrence Parsons noted as nebulous.  As a result IC 1559 did not receive a NGC number despite being observed twice by Mitchell, later seen by Lawrence Parsons and even suspected by Schultz.  Finally, it was observed again independently by Bigourdan on 7 Oct 1885 and by Javelle on 20 Nov 1897 and included in the IC as 1559.  Dreyer credited "LdR", along with Bigourdan and Javelle, as the discoverer.

No visible core.  Several brighter stars are in the field includes a star at the SW edge.  Located 46' N of 26 Ceti.

Max Wolf discovered IC 1613 on a plates taken with the Bruce 16-inch telescope in Sep 1906.  Wolf's position (given in 1885 coordinates) is ~10' south and 1.5 minutes of time preceding the galaxy.  As he used BD stars to measure positions, its very possible the coordinates for the "densest part" are for 1855.  If so, his position is near the center of IC 1613!

William Baade first showed it was extragalactic in 1935 and a year later Hubble included it as a Local Group member.  The distance is ~2.4 million light years.

IC 1623A, the brighter western component, appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 25" diameter, high surface brightness.  IC 1634B, attached on the east end, appeared as a fairly faint, small glow that not separately resolved, just a bulge or knot on the east end.  365x revealed a broad concentration with a brighter nucleus.  Research reveals the IC 1634B is optically obscured but very bright in the infrared indicating intense star formation.  IC 1622 lies 3.1' SW.

James Dunlop discovered IC 1633 = D 437 = Sw XI-13 on 5 Aug 1826 and recorded "an extremely faint small nebula; round, with a very minute bright point in the center."  Dunlop's position is 6.6' southwest of ESO 243-046, but this is a typical error and there no other brighter candidates.  Lewis Swift independently discovered this galaxy on 29 Sep 1897, assumed it was new, and logged (list XI-13) "vF; S; R; no B* near; vF one following."  Dreyer credited Swift and DeLisle Stewart (who measured the position on an Arequipa plate taken in 1899) with the discovery, but not Dunlop.

He reported the discovery directly to Dreyer who recatalogued it as IC 1656.  So, NGC 447 = IC 1656. In Barnard's notebook, he later added the comment "This is NGC 447.

30" (11/6/10 - Coonabarabran, 264x): fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, 36"x24", brighter core.  No resolution except for a single star on the west side.  Lindsay 93, a fainter cluster, lies 1.5' SE.  Located 3.7' WNW of a mag 10.9 star and 11' SW of the bright emission nebula NGC 456, which is the first of three striking clusters and nebulae with 460 and 465.

DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 1662 = D.S. 149 on a photographic plate taken on 27 Nov 1900 at Harvard's station in Arequipa, Peru.  He noted "vF, eS, neb or vS group of stars."  His position is accurate.

18" (12/17/11): extremely faint, small, round, 20"-24" diameter, very low surface brightness.  Required averted vision to glimpse a few times, but confirmed.  The IC identification is uncertain due to a poor position by Swift.

18" (12/18/06): extremely faint, small, round, 0.4' diameter.  Appears as a very low surface brightness hazy spot without concentration.  Only visible intermittently with averted vision.  Located 4.8' W of brighter IC 93.  The B magnitude of 14.5 appears too bright (LEDA gives 15.3).

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1667 = Sw XI-16 on 6 Oct 1896 and reported "eF, pS, R, no * near, 8m * in field nf".  There is nothing near his position.  MCG suggests MCG -03-4-039 = IC 1667.  This galaxy is 1 min of time east and 3.5' north of Swift's position, though there is a mag 8.4 star 11' ENE that would have been in Swift's field.  So, despite the poor position (more common in his later years) and no mention of IC 93 = IC 1671, which he "discovered" twice and lies only 5' ESE, MCG -03-4-039 is a reasonable candidate.

18" (11/13/07): IC 1670 consists of a contact pair of spiral galaxies.  The brighter galaxy (IC 1670B) on the east side appeared fairly faint, fairly small.  At first glance I noticed a fairly high surface brightness knot ~20" in diameter but with careful viewing, faint extensions were seen oriented E-W, increasing the size to ~0.9'x0.3'.  The initial knot I noticed is the sharply concentrated core of the galaxy.  At the west edge is an attached companion, IC 1670A, just 1' between centers.  IC 1670A appeared very faint, very small, round, just 0.2' diameter.  Apparently I only viewed the core of this edge-on galaxy.  Located ~3' SW of a mag 11 star.  IC 93 lies 15' SSE.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 1670 = Sw XI-17 on 18 Dec 1895 and recorded "vF; pS; lE; wide D * near nf; f of 2."  There is nothing at his position, but 6' northwest is this double system.  In list XI  he called IC 1671 = IC 93  "p[receding] of 2", but these orientations are reversed.

IC 1695 is the brightest member of Shakhbazian 40, which corresponds with the central region of AGC 193.  Nine additional galaxies ranging from V = 15.0 to V = 17.0 were visible in the 488x field: Shkh 40-14, 40-23, 40-29, 40-39, 40-43, 40-44, 40-56, 40-57, UGC 967.

But with a redshift of z = .048 compared to .008, this galaxy lies six times further away in the heart of AGC 193 and Shk 40!  At 225x it appeared faint to fairly faint, small, irregular round, slightly brighter core.  The core or a stellar knot seemed offset to one side (double galaxy).  A mag 12 star is less than 1' NW.  This description is quite similar to the one two months back.

18" (10/8/05): The brightest member of AGC 193 and Shakhbazian 40 appeared faint, small, irregularly round.  Situated just 43" SE of a mag 13 star.  In moments of better seeing this galaxy appeared double with an extremely faint knot or extension to the northeast of the core of the main galaxy.  The next day I checked the DSS and this observation matches the image!  This distant cluster has a redshift of z = .048 which corresponds to a distance of over 700 million light years.

E.E. Barnard found IC 1712 on 10 Dec 1888 while observing his comet discovery C/1888 RI with the comet nearly occulting the galaxy!  He commented "The comet's nucleus passed some 30" N of the nucleus of the nebula.  The comet is probably 5 times as bright as the nebula and is a great many times larger."  The discovery was reported directly to Dreyer, who catalogued it again as IC 1712.  As Barnard's position is nearly identical to NGC 584, it's strange Dreyer didn't noticed the equivalence, though Barnard later added in his notebook "NGC 584".

13" (11/5/83): very faint, moderately large, diffuse, ill-defined, elongated NNW-SSE, no central condensation.  Forms a pair with NGC 672 8' NE.

Isaac Roberts discovered IC 1727 photographically on 29 Nov 1896 with his 20" reflector from his Starfield Observatory in England.  He reported (AN 3429) "It is nearly as large as NGC 672 and distant from centre to centre 8' only; nucleus consists of 6 faint stellar condensations forming a straight line in the direction south following to north preceding and there are 6 or 7 very faint condensations of nebulosity near the preceding margin; 15th mag star on the north preceding margin and a 16th mag star at the south following end of the nucleus."  Roberts was very amazed that this galaxy was missed by WH, JH and at Birr Castle (7 observations of NGC 672) and he felt this object must have "come into the state of visibility during the past half century."

48" (10/27/16): at 610x; very bright, small, round, aqua (blue-green) color, 12" diameter.  The planetary is annular (though not a high contrast) with a darker center.  The rim is unevenly lit, slightly mottled, and brighter along the entire eastern side.

48" (10/23/11): at 375x appeared as a very bright, small, bluish planetary with an irregularly brighter rim, slightly fainter on the west side of the rim.  At 488x, this is a very interesting annular planetary with a relatively thick brighter rim that appears clumpy and a dark center.  The rim dims, though, on the west side, so the annularity is incomplete.  Overall the impression is a thick crescent spanning 270°.

18" (11/17/08): immediately picked up at 175x as a small bluish disc, ~12" diameter.  Situated within a distinctive 20' curving chain of stars that passes through much of the field.  Very good contrast gain using an OIII filter.  At 450x, the planetary is slightly elongated WNW-ESE, ~15"x12", and weakly annular.  At 800x it appeared irregularly brighter along the rim with a knotty structure, particularly along the northern half.  Located 30' SE of mag 3.4 Epsilon Cas.

The spectrum consists of a bright band having wavelength of about 5000.  Therefore, this object has been assumed to be a gaseous nebula."

Based on Crossley photographs, Heber Curtis (1918) described, "central star about mag 14.  Nearly round disk 13" in diameter, with an indistinct ring effect, strongest in the north and south and fading out along an axis in pa 90° [E-W]."

In the 1980s, prominent broad lines appeared in the optical spectrum of Mrk 1018, a black-hole system and it was classified as a Sy1. The leading explanation for this change is that the accretion rate onto the black hole increased, energizing more of the gas and expanding the size of the broad-line region. But in 2016 it was found that in the past five years, Mrk 1018 had returned to its original state. This unusual transition is thought to be due to a decrease in the black-hole accretion rate.

Lewis Swift apparently independently found this object on 8 Oct 1896.  Sw. XI-34 (later IC 17882) was described as "vF; D* of = mag in nebulosity.  Curious object."  He added the note "This appears like a nebulous double star, but I think it is simply a double star in a nebula.  There is a vast difference between a nebulous star, and a star in a nebula."  Dreyer must have missed the close match of Swift's and JH's position and their descriptions are virtually identical.  So, NGC 823 = IC 1782.  See Corwin's notes.

18" (10/13/07): NGC 896 and IC 1795 form a bright, detailed HII region at the NW corner of the huge IC 1805 HII ring ("Heart Nebula").  This complex is split into three or 4 distinct sections by dust lanes (LDN 1359).  The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'.  To the west of the mag 10 star is a dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, moderately high surface brightness patch (NGC 896) of 2' diameter.  To the east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and following this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length.  It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has a small, brighter patch.  Initially, I thought the complex ended here on the NE side, but then additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west for several arc minutes increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.

17.5" (11/27/92): observation at 100x using an OIII filter.  This is the northeastern section of a large emission complex with NGC 896.  Very large, about 10' diameter, roundish, fainter than NGC 895 but still moderately bright.  A mag 9.5 star is embedded at the SE edge and several fainter stars are superimposed.  A small detached piece of nebulosity is visible about 10' N with a mag 11.5 off the south edge and several fainter stars are at the edges or superimposed.  NGC 896 and IC 1795 form the NE component with the IC 1805 ("Heart Nebula") complex spread out to the SE.

Lewis Swift is likely the original discoverer on 11 Sep 1885, but his position was 1.0 minute of time too small and Bigourdan assumed his discovery was new.  I suggested the equivalence of NGC 920 = IC 1799 = UGC 1943 to Corwin and Steinicke, instead of the standard identification NGC 920 = UGC 1920. They both concur with this identity.  See NGC 920, as well as Corwin's identification notes.

IC 1805 = Heart Nebula = LBN 656 = W4 = Ced 7 = Sh 2-190 = LBN 654 = Cr 26 = Mel 15

V = 6.5;  Size 100'x80'

18" (10/13/07): IC 1805, which is dubbed the "Heart Nebula", is a cluster (Cr 26 = Melotte 15) involved with a huge emission complex (LBN 654) . The central cluster Mel 15 was striking at 73x, consisting of a 20' scattered group of mag 8 and fainter stars (I estimated 17 stars mag 8-10.5). Embedded within the group is a smaller, fairly rich, 4'x2.5' oval ring with over three dozen stars. Most of the stars are located along the irregular ring, itself, and not in the interior. On the SW side is the brightest member mag 8 HD 15558, an O5-type giant, which has a mag 10.5 companion at 10" separation (ADS 1920). The central region is richest around this pair with 9 or 10 stars in total packed into a 1.6' region.

Adding an OIII filter, the cluster was encased in a fairly bright, irregular glow, ~12-15' in diameter and extending mostly to the east of the cluster. There appears to be dark lanes or obscuring dust involved as the surface brightness is irregular with brighter filaments within the glow. Fainter nebulosity extends to the east and then abruptly bifurcates into two branches, one heading NE and the other SE. There's a sharp border to the nebulosity at the split as the sky directly east immediately darkens, adding to the contrast.

Following the stream of nebulosity to the NE, it extends roughly 20' in that direction but then curves back sharply towards the west where it meanders for 30'-40', ending about 30' N of the cluster. Only 20' E of the bend at the NE corner is the fairly large open cluster, NGC 1027 (see notes) .

The southern river of nebulosity can be followed around in a huge loop. First it gently curves to the south or SSE for ~40' and then loops back sharply towards the west (this band forms the southern boundary of the "Heart") for at least 40', heading towards a distinctive N-S string of 5 stars with a length of 6'. This group is catalogued as Markarian 6 = Stock 7. At the south end of Mrk 6 are two doubles, ∑264 = 8.6/9.8 at 17" and ∑263 = 10/11 pair at 17".

At this point, the rim bends to the north and brightens noticeably in a 10' patch. It dims and continues on further to the north, passing about 25' W of the cluster and fades out pretty close to NGC 896, a nearly isolated bright patch to the NW of the main structure.  Near the northwest end of IC 1805 is Tombaugh 4, a low surface brightness cluster that requires high power to partially resolve.

I had now traced around the entire outline of the "Heart Nebula" visible on wide-field images, scanning over a degree and a half from north to south and perhaps 1.25° in extent from west to east. The entire outline, including the weaker interior glow, was also visible at 12.5x in my 80mm finder using an OIII filter, although without the detail visible in the main scope.

NGC 896 and IC 1795 are parts of a fairly bright, detailed region at the NW corner of this huge ring. The complex appears split into three or 4 distinct sections by dust lanes (LDN 1359). The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'. To the west of the mag 10 star is a dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, moderately high surface brightness glow (NGC 896) of 2' diameter. To the east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and east of this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length. It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has another small, brighter patch. Initially, I thought the complex ended here on the NE side, but additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west, increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.

Comparing my descriptions to the MegaStar outline, I noticed that the cluster Mrk 6 (perhaps it's an asterism) is not plotted, although the brighter stars are, of course. Secondly, the outline shows a large gap between the NW end of the Heart and NGC 896. Visually, it appeared the Heart Nebula extended closer to 896. Finally, I picked up additional nebulosity to the north of NGC 896 not shown on MegaStar. At the section of the rim ~25' W of Mel 15 is the "bright-rimmed cloud" BRC 5, which was not noticed visually, though contains many T Tauri candidates.

17.5" (11/27/92): about 125 stars forming a bright, very large 40' field at 100x.  In the center is an oval ring consisting of about 30 stars within a 4'-5' diameter including a bright 8th magnitude multiple star (Stein 368).  The brighter stars in the outer region form a rough incomplete circular outline.  Using 100x with an OIII filter, the associated nebulosity (LBN 654) is clearly entwined within a large portion of the cluster.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1805 photographically with the discovery communicated directly to Dreyer.  The NGC position is off by 1 tmin in RA (same as IC 1824 = NGC 1027).  Barnard gave a corrected position in his Atlas of the Milky Way.

The Heart (IC 1805) and Soul (IC 1848) nebulae are part of the Cas OB6 Association, a sprawling complex of gas, dust and massive O- and B-class stars at a distance ~7500 light years in the Perseus Arm.

18" (10/13/07): I only took a fairly quick look at this huge HII region ("Soul Nebula" or "Baby Nebula") at the end of the evening after a long examination of IC 1705 ("Heart Nebula").  In comparison, portions of this object clearly have a higher surface brightness using an OIII filter at 73x.  Near the center is an E-W elongated, scattered group of stars (Cr 32), ~10'x4' in size.  On the west end are two mag 7.3/8.3 stars (2' pair of O-class stars: HD 17505 (the primary ionization source) and HD 17520) with a number of fainter stars huddled nearby.  About 60' to the ENE is another larger, scattered group (Cr 34).  Weak nebulosity is evident throughout the field without a filter.

Adding an OIII filter greatly increases the contrast and nebulosity is fairly prominent in several different sections.  About 20' E of Cr 32 is a brighter, elongated patch.  To the east of this patch is a dark lane or intrusion and on the eastern side is a brighter, 10' circular glow (IC 1871) with an irregular outline. IC 1871 is located roughly 45' ENE of Cr 32.  This patch is irregular in surface brightness with brighter streaks.  A larger region spreads out to the east of the cluster increasing the total length to over 1.5 degrees.  I also noticed brighter regions of nebulosity to the west of Cr 32, but didn't take notes on this area or try to follow the entire outline of the complex.

17.5" (10/2/99): at 100x, this large but weak grouping is dominated by a 2' pair of mag 7/8 stars which are both surrounded by several close, faint companions.  The surrounding one degree field is undistinguished but it appears weakly concentrated around the bright pair.  Faint nebulosity is visible in portions of the field.  At 220x, the view is striking with ~12 stars huddled around the southern mag 9 star including a nice pair of mag 12 stars nearly collinear and equally spaced.  The brighter mag 7 star (∑306) is surrounded by 8-10 companions.  The 20' field is fairly rich but scattered with a matched pair of mag 9 stars ~10' N.

Using a UHC filter at 100x, the field is immersed in a very large, faint nebulosity about a degree in length, elongated E-W.  A large, bright region elongated N-S is at the east end, ~35  following the core, and seems detached from the main cloud.  It surrounds a weak scattered group (Cr 34) that is devoid of stars in the center.  The main body of nebulosity has a sharper border and is generally brighter to the north of the core and fades into the background on the south side.  The outline is interesting on the north side with irregular extensions and bulges.  A small brighter circular patch stands out at the west end about 10' W of the core.

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 1112, found by Marth in 1863, refers to this galaxy though his position 1 min of RA further east.  Marth's positions for NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117 are all off in RA, so this identification is not definite but very possible.  See my notes, Corwin's notes and Courtney Seligman's website entry for NGC 1109.


Albert Marth discovered NGC 1112 = m 77 on 2 Dec 1863 with Lassell's 48" on Malta and logged "F, pS".  This is the third in a group of 8 galaxies he discovered that night, several of which (NGC 1109, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1117) have identification problems because of poor positions or possibly he confused faint stars as nebulous.

Harold Corwin suggests NGC 1112 may refer IC 1852 = UGC 2293 = PGC 10660.  Stephane Javelle discovered this galaxy on 7 Jan 1896 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory.  Marth's position is exactly 1.0 min of RA following IC 1852 and matches in declination.  CGCG, UGC and MCG label this galaxy IC 1852, while RNGC, PGC, RC3 and Megastar identify it as NGC 1109.  RNGC classifies NGC 1112 as nonexistent.  Finally, HyperLEDA equates IC 1852 with NGC 1109.  Although NGC 1112 = IC 1852 is a reasonable match, given all the problems in this region this identification is very uncertain. See Corwin's notes for NGC 1109 and Courtney's Seligman website for NGC 1112.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 1883 on on 26 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  The discovery was communicated directly to Dreyer and not announced in any of his papers.  This galaxy was discovered first by Lewis Swift on 18 Oct 1884 and recorded in discovery paper I-5 (later NGC 1212) as "S; R; vvF.  Right angled with 2 stars.  In field with Algol".  Swift's position is poor, 40 seconds of RA west of UGC 2560, but his description of the two stars applies to this galaxy.  Barnard and Dreyer assumed this was probably a new object due to Swift's poor position.  So, NGC 1212 = IC 1883, with discovery priority to Swift.

At 450x, the dimmer quadrant on the NW side appears to bulge out slightly and the brighter region, centered to the SE, extends in an arc from the NE to the SW.  An occasional stellar sparkle was clearly visible, though it was difficult to pinpoint the location.

17.5" (3/1/03): easily picked up at 100x as a fuzzy blue-gray mag 11.5 star.  Excellent view at 380x: bright, small, 10" diameter, irregularly round with an irregular surface brightness.  There appears to be a knot (or offset central star?) on the SE side.  A mag 13.7 star is just off the SW side [18" from center].  Located 3' SW of a wide mag 9.5/11 pair.

8" (12/4/80): moderately bright, very small, just non-stellar at 125x and a definite disc is visible at 220x.  A wide double star is 3' NE (9.5/11 at 47" oriented NW-SE).

Thomas Espin discovered IC 2003 on 18 Jan 1907 with his 17.3-inch reflector while searching for new double star.  He estimated a diameter of 5" but the following measured measured a size of 6.9"x6.35" in PA 10.5°.

Herbert Howe discovered IC 2047 = Ho. III-15 on 20 Jan 1900 and reported "eF, eS, difficult; near [NGC 1538]."   His position matches LEDA 941480.  Howe assumed Holm 73a = LEDA 3093623 was NGC 1538 as it is the closest galaxy to Stone's (rough) position.  But Harold Corwin, who examined Stone's sketch, states that IC 2047 is a better match with the sketch.  This implies Stone missed IC 2045 (also found by Howe), which is the brightest of the galaxies in this field.

17.5" (12/26/00): this unusual yellow reflection nebula (also catalogued as Barnard 14) is embedded in Barnard 22 within the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud, the nearest large stellar nursery at 450 light-years.  At 100x (unfiltered), IC 2087 appears as a fairly faint direct vision object, moderately large, round, 3'-4' diameter.  Fairly well defined although the edges fade into background.  What is the striking is the location - only four brighter stars are visible in the 50' field with a complete lack of fainter stars down to mag 15!  The surrounding field also shows evidence of very high obscuration (extinction about 5 visual magnitudes in the vicinity).  Described by Barnard as a "very small, bright nebula, diameter 3"... "in the dark nebula B 22".

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2087 visually on 18 Jan 1892 with the 12-inch Lick refractor while observing a comet.  He noted "the small nebula is excessively difficult".  His photograph in "On a Nebulous Groundwork in the Constellation Taurus" (ApJ, 25, p218, 1907) reveals a long winding dark lane with a small nebulous region surrounding a couple of stars within the dark lane.

Size 180'x60'

13x80mm (1/15/07): first visual observation I've made of the Witch-Head nebula.  Using the 80mm finder at 13x (24mm Panoptic) without a filter a very large, ill-defined glow (~30'-40') was visible between 1-1.5° south of Beta Eridani.  This is the NE section of this faint reflection nebula.  With averted vision the glow brightened and stood out fairly well compared to the background sky brightness.  This object is significantly fainter than Barnard's Loop but was surprisingly was not a marginal observation or as difficult as expected.  I couldn't follow the nebula further south with any certainty.

Max Wolf discovered IC 2118 on a plate taken on 16 Jan 1891 with a 4-inch Millet portrait lens (1 hr exposure).  The discovery was announced in "The Great Nebula of Psi Eridani", MNRAS 65, 528 (1905).  There is no reference to the "Witchhead" shape in the paper.

Solon Bailey discovered IC 2128 = D 176 photographically in 1896 using a 1-inch Cooke lens at the Arequipa station in Peru.  The discovery was announced in the 1908 "Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae", Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 60, p199.  Cozins and Steinicke credit James Dunlop with discovery on 27 Oct 1826 with his 9" reflector at his home in Parramatta, New South Wales.  Dunlop noted D 176 as "a small faint nebula" and his position is close southeast of IC 2128.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 2133 = Big. 385 on 22 Dec 1891.  His position matches NGC 1961, which was discovered by William Herschel in 1788 but given an erroneous position.  In the 1912 "Scientific Papers of William Herschel" Dreyer writes, "Caroline Herschel has used the place of the comparison star in Wollaston's Catalogue of 1790, which is very erroneous.  Auwers assumed it to be B.A.C. 1985, hence his very erroneous polar distance.  But it is = G. 1199 agreeing with two other stars, 42 and 43 Camelop.  The place of the neb found from this coincides with that of I.C. 2133 = Bigourdan 385."  So, NGC 1961 = IC 2133.  See Corwin's notes for more.

Lewis Swift found IC 2135 = Sw XI-81 on 22 Feb 1898 and logged "eeeF; eeS; eeeE; eeF.  See note."  His RA is 35 seconds too small but the identification is certain.  The note reads "Nos. 56 [[IC 335 = IC 1963] and 81 [IC 2135].  These in one respect are the most interesting nebulae I have ever seen, especially No. 56, which is a nebulous hair-line of one uniform size from end to end.  No. 81 at first sight seemed identical with it, but on a closer view the center seemed to have a very slight bulging in the middle."  

Swift actually discovered the galaxy on 9 Dec 1895, calling it "eF; pS; eE; almost a ray; 1963 p."  But his position was 10° too far north, so it was assumed Sw XI-82 = IC 2136 were different objects.  IC 2136 is another observation, though placed 10 degrees too far north!

This pair of low excitation emission knots is situated midway between two mag 6 stars with a 50' separation near the edge of the 20mm Nagler field.  Close southwest of Sh 2-257 is a very faint patch of nebulosity, Sh 2-256, but this was not seen visually, nor was the larger HII region Sh 2-254, a low surface brightness glow to the west (11' diameter).

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2162 visually on 30 Nov 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He first logged in his notebook "Found a v. difficult neb close f and involving a 10m star."  He added the comments "vF neb, pL, roundish, densest part following the 10m star." His field sketch pins down the identification with Sh 2-255 (eastern of a pair of faint HII glows).

48" (2/20/12): IC 2163 was stunning at 488x, attached at the east side of NGC 2207.  The central region is very bright, round, ~1' diameter, small bright core.  Attached on the southwest side is a spiral arm that gracefully sweeps to the east while curving gently clockwise.  The arm is ~1.5' long and significantly increases the overall size to roughly 2'x1'.

Just NE off the tip of the eastern arm is 2MASX J06163579-2122032, which appears as a faint, very small knot.  Although this galaxy does not have a measured redshift, an HST study of NGC 2207/IC2163 (2001AJ....121..182E) found several apparent old globular clusters in its outer regions suggesting it's a dwarf elliptical galaxy at the same distance as IC 2163.

18" (2/5/11): forms the eastern component of an impressive interacting pair with NGC 2207.  At 225x, IC 2163 is an elongated glow embedded on the east side of the halo of the brighter galaxy.  IC 2163 appears fairly faint, moderately large, oval E-W, 1.0'x0.7', weakly concentrated.

13.1" (1/28/84): this is a colliding system with NGC 2207.  A double nucleus is visible and an extension just seen to the east is probably IC 2163.

Herbert Howe discovered IC 2163 = Ho I-7 on 11 Feb 1898 with the 20-inch Clark refractor at Chamberlin Observatory in Colorado. He noted "eF, pS, follows NGC 2207 [by] 7 seconds."

E.E. Barnard found IC 2172 on 30 Oct 1888 using the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted a "9 1/2 mag star with faint nebulosity about it.  1' in diameter, a little heavier nf.  Examined several other stars near, and no nebulosity seen."  His position corresponds with NGC 2282, discovered by Barnard himself on 3 Mar 1886 with the 6-inch refractor at Vanderbilt University (announced in AN 2756 and Sidereal Messenger, vol. 5, p154). ?He reported finding "a star of 9.5 or 10 magnitiude, with a faint nebulosity surrounding it. I strongly suspect that is not a stellar point but an extremely small nebula with faint nebulosity surrounding. ?At best with the 6-inch it did not appear like any of the neighboring stars. ?A short distance (4' or 5') preceding this and very slightly north is a faint double star that I suspect is enveloped in nebulosity." ?His position matches the central star HD 289120 of this reflection nebula.  Neither Barnard nor Dreyer noticed the equivalence of NGC 2282 and IC 2172.

07 05 06 -10 42
Size 120'x40'

13x80mm (1/17/09): excellent view using of the Seagull Nebula using the 80mm finder with a 24mm Panoptic and a NPB filter.  This long sinuous river of nebulosity winds for approximately two degrees ~N-S beginning just south of open cluster NGC 2335 and curving to the west of a 4' pair of mag 5.4/7.7 stars, midway along its length.  The south end is skewed and curves towards the SE.  The nebula is brighter along a central filament, particularly near the midway point and a dark notch intrudes on the west side just south.  Although the 18" at 73x and UHC filter added more detail and structure only half of the entire Seagull could be viewed in one field.

13.1" (1/19/85): at 62x and UHC filter appears as a very large, very elongated strip of nebulosity.  At the north end is the open cluster NGC 2335 within Monoceros.  The southern portion is difficult to trace; it crosses into Canis Major and ends at an easily visible reflection nebula = Ced 90 surrounding a mag 8 star.  Also includes nebula NGC 2327 midway along the length.  This emission/reflection nebula is referred to as the Eagle or Seagull Nebula.

17.5" (2/2/02): On the NW side is a circular nebulosity (the head of the Seagull) catalogued as Gum 1 = vdB 93 = Sh 2-292.  At 100x it appeared as a very large, circular glow perhaps 15' in diameter of low surface brightness surrounding mag 7.1 V750 Mon with vague hints of structure. The OIII filter gave only a very weak enhancement, but the H-beta filter noticeably improved the contrast at low power.  This combination HII/reflection nebula is situated off the NW end of the huge winding IC 2177 strip that extends mostly to the south, and is a wonderfully rich region of the Milky Way with a number of clusters and star groups in the vicinity.

Off the south side is the smaller nebula Ced 90.  At 64x it appeared as a faint, round, 3'  haze surrounding a mag 8.5 star.  Two mag 10.5 stars are collinear off the east side, 2.5' and 3.3' from the center and several mag 12 stars are involved at the south edge.  The H-beta filter noticeably improves the contrast and makes the nebulosity a moderately bright, direct-vision object.  With averted vision the glow increases to 4'-5' in diameter with some very faint haze extending east.  The star density drops off immediately to the west, except for a few stars.  Ced 90 is located at the extreme southern tip of the 2.5 degree giant emission nebula IC 2177, which extends north into Monoceros.  This is one of a select group of low-excitation nebulae that can be added to the list of H-beta objects.

Isaac Roberts discovered IC 2177 photographically in 1898 surrounding mag 7.3 BD-10 1848.  His position (for the mag 7 star) and dimensions of 13' corresponds with the position of vdB 93 = Gum 1 = Sh 2-292, not the 2° N-S strip of nebulosity that is commonly identified as IC 2177 in modern catalogues!  The often photographed strip was discovered by Max Wolf in 1905.  See Corwin's comments for the full story!

Unfiltered at 105x, a fairly large irregular glow is visible surrounding the bright red M-class variable V341 Car = HD 65750 (mag 6.2-7.1).  The nebula is bowed towards the west with the curved section on the following side of V341.  It extends furthest to the NW and the SW and is indented and weaker due west of the star.  The total size of the "Toby Jug" is 2'-3'.

IC 2220 was named the Toby Jug Nebula by Paul Murdin, David Allen and David Malin in their book "Catalogue of the Universe" published in 1979.  David Malin included the Toby Jug Nebula in his 1999 book "The Invisible Universe" and wrote, "A few degrees from the bright star Avoir and a little south of Miaplacidus is a curious nebula with the uninspiring catalog name IC 2220.  It has a popular name taken from its superficial resemblance to the profile of a toby jug, a traditional English beer mug with a large handle, with one side molded as a stout character with a rustic, painted face. My colleagues and I suggested the name Toby Jug in our book "Catalogue of the Universe" in 1978, and it seems to have stuck, even in the United States, where toby jugs are rarely seen."

Stephane Javelle found IC 2229 = J. 3-1025 on 11 Feb 1896 and reported "faint, nearly round, 30", mottled, stellar nucleus 13.5-14."  His position matches IC 496 = J. 1-153, which Javelle first discovered on 2 Mar 1892.  Both positions are very accurate, so its surprising neither he nor Dreyer noticed IC 496 = IC 2229.

Stephane Javelle found IC 2232 = J. 3-1028 on 12 Feb 1896.  His position matches UGC 4273 = PGC 23028.  This galaxy was discovered earlier by William Herschel but his position for NGC 2543 was 10 seconds of RA too small and his declination 5' too far south.  A second observation was even further off in declination.  John Herschel's position was off by two minutes in RA.  Dreyer published Spitaler's corrected position for NGC 2543 in the IC 1 notes section, but didn't catch the equivalence with Javelle's position.

William Herschel discovered NGC 2543 = H II-719 = h493 on 3 Feb 1788 (sweep 803) and recorded "F, pL, iR, bM."  His position is 10 sec of RA west and 5' south of UGC 4273. A second observation from 10 Mar 1790 (sweep 937) reads "In a line with a N.p. star, pB, cL, iR, vgbM."  The second observation is even further off in dec.

JH noted "vF; R; a course double * precedes points to it.  Deta RA = 1 m 2 sec."  There is nothing at his position but two minutes of RA west is UGC 4273 and two stars at 1.6' separation are northwest.  The RA given in the GC and NGC is ~1.0 tmin too far east but Rudolph Spitaler's micrometric position (measured on 24 Dec 1891 with the 27" refractor at Wien University Observatory) is accurate.  Stephane Javelle independently found the galaxy on 12 Feb 1896, assumed it was new and reported it in list 3-1028 (later IC 2232) with an accurate position.  So, NGC 2543 = IC 2232.

48" (4/15/10): this remarkably thin, beautiful superthin edge-on extends 4.0'x0.25' (~15:1 axial ratio) NNW-SSE.  Contains a brighter elongated central region with a slightly brighter nucleus (though no bulge).  The overall surface brightness is fairly low and the galaxy gradually dims near the ends of the extensions.  The center is situated only 0.9' SW of a mag 10 double (a mag 13.5 companion lies 13" away) and the orientation aligns with the center of the galaxy.  Roughly midway along the northern extension is a mag 14 star.  Beyond this star the galaxy gradually fades to the tip, extending to within 0.6' of a faint star off the NNW tip.  On the south extension, the galaxy also fades, but after nearly dimming out there is a feeble glow at the very tip that is slightly angled or bent towards the east.  Located 17' SE of the Bear-Paw galaxy.

17.5" (2/24/90): very faint, moderately large, extremely thin edge-on NNW-SSE with a low even surface brightness.  A mag 14 star is embedded at the north tip and a mag 11/14 double star at 13" separation is off the east side 1.0' from center.  Located 17' SSE of NGC 2537.  This galaxy is one of the thinnest known.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 2311 = Ho I-8 visually on 27 Jan 1889 using the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  It was found sweeping along with NGC 2566, which was described as "the S. of 2, roundish, pB, two stars involved."  IC 2311 was noted as "the N one is pB, S, R, stellar nucleus (?).  It is 1/2 [150 dia field = 8'] north of the above neb.  They are both among scattered stars."  He later added the note "one of these is new - the other probably = NGC 2566."

Herbert Howe independently rediscovered this galaxy on 16 Feb 1898 with the 20-inch Clark Refractor at Chamberlin Observatory in Colorado.  He noted "pB, vS, R, lbM, 6' n of NGC 2566" and measured an accurate position.  Barnard apparently never notified Dreyer (along with other discoveries) and Howe is credited with the discovery in the IC, though Barnard's observation was 9 years earlier.

Perhaps a better view is obtained in the 9x50 finder or 10x30 IS binoculars which does a nice job of resolving the brighter stars, but the group is really too sparse and scattered to look impressive in the 13".

Al-Sufi first mentioned IC 2391 = Lac II-5 around 644 AD as a "nebulous star."  Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille observed it in 1751-1752 during his journey to the Cape and described a "small heap of stars" in his 1/2-inch refractor.  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" (f/13) Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this bright naked-eye group includes mag 5.5 HX Velorum on the west side.  Resolved in the 9x50 finder.  In the 13.1", roughly three dozen stars are visible in a 10' field.  The bright stars are scattered mostly on the following side of the group in an elongated arrangement extending to the southeast.  There is also a fairly rich gathering of stars within 4' of HX Vel.  NGC 2660 is located 48' S.

Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered IC 2395 = Lac. III-3 between 1751-1752 during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded "Star of 6th magnitude, connected to another more southern one by a nebulous trail."  Solon Bailey independently discovered the cluster photographically in 1896 with a 1" Cook lens at the Arequipa station in Peru.  The discovery was published in his 1908 paper "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae, Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII.  Dreyer missed Lacaille earlier discovery and Bailey is credited in the IC.

Brent Archinal noted the equivalence of this cluster with vdB-Ha 47.  The Lynga position for IC 2395 is incorrect but OK for vdB-Ha 47.  Brian Skiff gives a centroid position of 08 42 31 -48 06.5 (2000).

Ralph Copeland discovered IC 2411 on 26 Dec 1873 with LdR's 72-inch telescope and noted "cF, pS, lE pf; was thought to have an eF companion about 2' nf."  Dreyer followed this up on 21 Feb 1876, saying, "eF; I think it is only a * 16 m +- nf."  Because of his uncertainty Dreyer didn't assign this galaxy an IC designation.  

Max Wolf discovered it again on a Heidelberg plate on 13 Jan 1901 and assumed it was new.  Dreyer catalogued it as IC 2411, with no mention of the prior discovery. Corwin notes that "Had Dreyer been observing on a somewhat better night, or (perhaps) with a freshly-polished mirror, the fainter galaxy might also have received an NGC number."

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): IC 2554 is a remarkable interacting multiple system or a single merger remnant with a tidal tail.   At 260x it consists of what appears to be a contact pair of edge-ons with just slightly different orientations (both ~SSW-NNE) that run into each other.  The southern portion is brighter and larger, ~1.4'x0.3', while the northern component is perhaps half as long, though they appeared nearly merged so it was difficult to clearly distinguish.  With averted vision, the appearance is even more confusing as there is a strong impression of an additional component or feature in the chain.  NGC 3136B lies 8.3' ENE.  IC 2554 is located 27' NE of NGC 3136.

48" (2/21/12): This large, low surface brightness dwarf irregular in the M81 group?extends roughly 10'x4' SW-NE with only a weak, broad concentration.  The galaxy is dominated by a giant star forming/HII complex near the NE end of the galaxy.  At 375x, four separate, compact knots were easily resolved within a 1.2' region, though the brighter glow from the entire complex spans roughly 1.5'x1.0' from WSW to ENE.  The brightest and largest knot carries the designation IC 2574:[HK83] #15, from Hodge and Kennicutt's "An Atlas of H II regions in 125 Galaxies" in AJ, 88, 296 (1983).  This high surface brightness knot is very bright, slightly elongated N-S, 20"x15", and is situated at the NW vertex of the four knots.  #13/34 is a fainter irregular knot of ~12" diameter at the NE vertex.  #35 forms the SE vertex and appears as a faint, round knot, only 8"-10" in size, just 24" SSW of #13/#34.  The knot at the SW vertex is not listed in the H-K atlas, but is catalogued in NED as radio source NVSS J102844+682809.  It appeared similar to #35, though slightly elongated, and is situated only 20" S of #15.  At 488x, a 5th knot was seen ~30" SW of #15, and appeared as a very faint, ill-defined 15" glow (this region contains #17 and #19).

17.5" (3/12/94): faint, very large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 7.0'x2.5', low surface brightness, no concentration.  Four faint stars are near the north side.  There is a fairly bright nonstellar HII region that is clearly visible at the NE end as a high surface brightness knot.  Member of the M81 group  (distance ~12 million l.y.).

Edwin Coddington discovered IC 2574 at Lick Observatory on a plate of the M81/82 region taken on 17 and 20 Apr 1898 with the 6" Crocker telescope (Willard Lens).  The discovery was announced in PASP 10, 123 (1898).  He noted he observed it visually on the 22nd with the 12-inch refractor.  Also, on 19 May, Coddington obtained an additional photograph that showed "the different condensations to be connected by faint nebulous matter, and the whole to extend over an area fully 4' in width and 12' in length."

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I only took a quick look at the "Gabriela Mistral" Nebula nebula at 200x and a UHC filter, but the brightest portion appeared like a cartoon drawing of a whale with a huge, very bright bulbous "head" forming the northern end of the nebula.  The brightest portion is perhaps 15'x6' in size, but quite an extensive amount of fainter nebulosity spreads out the east and southeast of the main body, significantly increasing the size to ~15'x11', elongated N-S.  Some faint nebulosity also spreads to the west of the main portion.  At the south end is the mag 5.5 star HD 92207.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): striking HII region and cluster 30' SE of NGC 3293 and 90' NW of the center of the Eta Carina nebula! (this is an outlying piece of the Eta Carina complex)  At 105x and UHC filter this huge, elongated, irregular nebula is quite bright, perhaps 15'x6' in size and tapers towards the south end where mag 5.5 HD 92207 is embedded.  The nebula widens to a well-defined bulbous mass on the north end.  Faint nebulosity hooks off the north end and spreads to the east and northeast.  This HII region is ionized by mag 8 HD 92206 = h4338 (an 8.2/9.2 pair at 5") situated near the center of the nebula.  Unfiltered, a scattered group of stars is superimposed but this just appears to be a random star grouping in the Carina section of the Milky Way.

Williamina Fleming found IC 2599 = southern part of NGC 3324 on a plate taken in May 1893 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  In Annals of Harvard College Observatory, vol. 26, page 207, Pickering mentions it surrounds AGC 14525 (SAO 238271) and "has not received a number in Dreyer's catalog".

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): with the naked-eye, an obvious halo is visible around mag 2.7 Theta Carinae but only a few stars are resolved naked eye.  In the 9x50mm finder, a couple of dozen stars are resolved in a one degree region.  The "Southern Pleiades" is really too large and too scattered for an impressive view in the 13".  The cluster includes about a dozen mag 6-7.5 stars scattered in the field and a couple of mag 5 stars, along with blue-colored Theta (B-V = -0.2), a well known Blue Straggler.  Most of the bright stars are located in two main groups; a 45' string extending north and southwest of Theta and a large, detached, rectangular group of stars on the east end of the cluster, roughly 25' from Theta.  Melotte 101 lies 40' SSW and is described below.

Melotte 101
14.5" (4/4/16 - Coonabarabran, 73x and 147x): beautiful, very large cluster, centered 12' E of a mag 5.5 star.  Roughly 120-150 stars are resolved, depending on the assumed size. There is no distinct boundary so the size is pretty arbitrary but most of the brighter stars are within a 8'-10' circle.  Many of the stars are arranged in long chains and loops.  The brightest mag 9.7 star is at the west end, but the majority of the stars are 12-13 magnitude.

Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered IC 2602 = Lac II-9 in 1751-1752 with a 1/2-inch telescope at 8x during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.  He recorded "The star Theta Navis, of the third magnitude or less, surrounded by a large number of stars of 6th, 7th & 8th magnitude, which resemble the Pleiades."  The nickname "Southern Pleiades derives from this description.  Solon Bailey also found the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" (f/13) Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.

48" (5/4/16): this number refers to the brighter southwestern spiral arm of NGC 3395.  A fairly easy, well-defined (inner) spiral arm is on the south side of the galaxy; it rotates sharply counterclockwise nearly 180°, ending on the east side of the galaxy.

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 2605 = Big. 402 on 11 Apr 1899 while observing NGC 3395.  According to Harold Corwin, Bigourdan commented, ""Nebulous rounded object, about 20 arcsec across, it would be nearly impossible to make measurements." and estimated an offset of 0.5 seconds of time west and 17" south from the nucleus.  Corwin identifies this with the brighter inner spiral arm just south of the core of the galaxy.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): picked up by blinking with an OIII filter at 76x (27 Panoptic) and appeared as a slightly fuzzy bluish "star".  Excellent contrast gain using the filter.  Situated in the middle of a string of 3 stars with a mag 11.5 star 1' NW and a mag 10.8 star 75" SE.  Appears ~0.5 magnitudes fainter than the SE star (giving an estimated V mag of 11.3) but significantly brighter using the OIII filter.  Appears quasi-stellar at 228x, perhaps 3" diameter at most.  Located 2° SE of IC 2502 = "Southern Pleiades".

Joseph Lunt discovered IC 2621 = HN 106 visually in 1901 with the Cape Observatory 24-inch refractor fitted with an object-glass prism.  He noted "a stellar nebula found visually wit the 24-inch o.g. prism.  Mag 10-11."  Williamina Fleming found it independently again in 1907 on a Harvard objective prism plate taken at the Arequipa station.

48" (4/20/17): fairly bright, fairly large, asymmetric face-on spiral.  IC 2627 has a very lopsided appearance with one long, prominent arm and a second shorter and less contrasty arm.  The central section consists of a bright, oval core highlighted by a stellar nucleus.  A strong, knotty arm emerges on the southeast side of the core and gracefully unfurls counterclockwise towards the west on the south side.  It significantly fades just east of a mag 16 star [50" WSW of center].  With averted vision, though, the arm could be followed about 1' further north of this star, but the surface brightness was extremely low.  The second arm was more subtle and seemed detached from the core.  It extended E-W, ~30" length, on the north side of the core and had a sharp northern edge.  Several mag 16.5 stars are superimposed or nearby.

18" (3/29/03): fairly large but fairly faint roundish glow.  Has an irregular surface brightness at 300x with a patchy appearance (face-on spiral with an asymmetrically brighter arm and knotty appearance on the DSS).  Located 8.4' ESE of mag 9.9 SAO 179590.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2627 = Sw XI-120 on 10 Apr 1898 and reported "eF; L; R; sev st in L semi circle n, in finder field with Beta Crateris."  Herbert Howe noted it has "a stellar nucleus of mag 13.5."

Size 10'

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): surprisingly bright, very large reflection nebula surrounding the mag 9.0 T Tauri-type star HD 97300.  It extends nearly 8' in diameter (fades around the edges) and is essentially round.  It was missed by John Herschel although he picked up NGC 3620, a faint galaxy 32' NE.  IC 2631 is not plotted in Tirion's Sky Atlas 2000, Uranometria 2000 (both 1st and 2nd editions) nor the Millennium Star Atlas.

Several fields to the south of IC 2631 (bright reflection nebula nebula) were strangely devoid of stars due to the huge molecular Chamaeleon Dark Cloud.  Only a few brighter stars were visible in the 30' field at 200x (13mm Ethos).  The center is roughly 40' S of IC 2631 and the dark cloud appears elongated 2:1, roughly 90'x45' N-S.

The Chamaeleon dark cloud complex is a complicated structure consisting of 3 large molecular clouds (designated Cha I, II, III by Hoffmeister 1963) and a number of smaller clumps and globules.  The region I observed corresponds with Cha I and contains the reflection nebula Ced 110 = GN 11.04.8 and Ced 111 (surrrounding T Tauri stars HD 97048 = CU Cha and DI Cha).

DeLisle Stewart discovered IC 2631 = D.S. 352 on a plate taken on 22 May 1900 at Harvard's Arequipa Station.  He noted "* 9 involved in neb of 2' radius."

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was a surprisingly appealing cluster, roughly 13' in diameter and framed nicely in the 30' field at 200x in the 13mm Ethos.  The stars are fairly uniform in brightness with a large number of mag 11-12.5 stars and they give the impression of being connected in numerous loops and chains over the entire cluster.  The cluster is not concentrated, though there are several mag 11 stars near the center and a close double.  Mel 105 is located 48' SSE.

James Dunlop discovered IC 2714 = D 281 on 27 Apr 1826 with his 9-inch reflector at Paramatta, NSW.  He described a "cluster of very small stars, a little elongated preceding and following, about 10' diameter; the stars are congregated towards the centre, a pretty bright star south, and a double star south following this."  His position was ~7' too far north.

Solon Bailey independently discovered the cluster in 1896 on a photographic plate using a 1" f/13 Cook lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII) and Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC.  His description reads "cluster, pretty compressed."

Royal H. Frost discovered IC 2966 = F. 791 = D 266? on a photographic plate taken  5 May 1904 with the 24-inch refractor at the Arequipa station.  It's possible that James Dunlop discovered it first on 8 May 1826 and recorded "A very small nebula, very bright immediately at the center; the bright point is nearly equal in brightness to one of the minute stars north of the nebula.  I do not think the bright point is a star, but a very high condensed nucleus, surrounded by a faint chevelure, not more than 10" diameter.  Another very minute nebula precedes it."  Dunlop's position is 16' too far northwest, so this identification is not certain.

Van den Bergh and Herbst included this object as No. 56 in their Catalogue of Southern Stars Embedded in Nebulosity (AJ, 1975), noting that it had a high surface brightness and was equally bright on both the red and blue plates.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 2979 = J. 3-1201, along with IC 2981, on 12 Jun 1896.  There is nothing at the IC position, but Harold Corwin and Malcolm Thomson found that Javelle made a 1 degree error in the north polar distance of his offset star.  Once corrected, his position fits UGC 6925 perfectly.  Due to this error, modern catalogues fail to identify their equivalent entries as IC 2979.  NED and HyperLeda now use the IC designation.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 2981 = J. 3-1202, along with IC 2979, on 12 Jun 1896.   He used the same comparison star (BD +33 2172) for IC 2979 for which there was a one degree error its north polar distance, but after making this correction there is nothing at the position for IC 2981.  None of the major galaxy catalogues include a listing for IC 2981 except for MOL (Master Optical List) and NGC 2000 (at the incorrect IC declination).  However, Corwin found that reversing the sign of the RA offset points directly at CGCG 157-056 = PGC 37462.  This identification is given here.

To further confuse the issue, PGC 37462 is misidentified as NGC 3966 in RNGC, MCG, CGCG and PGC.  Max Wolf suggested that Heinrich d'Arrest's single position was 30 seconds off in RA.  His "corrected" position is given in the IC 2 Notes and matches PGC 37462.  But Harold Corwin (e-mail from 3/6/98) found that d'Arrest's description did not match this galaxy, particularly the nearby mag 12-13 star.  d'Arrest mentions he was searching for h1027 = NGC 3986, and this galaxy matches his description of the nearby star!  So, despite a poor match in RA and Dec, NGC 3966 = NGC 3986, instead.

J.L.E. Dreyer probably discovered IC 2982 = Big. 285 = NGC 4004B on 5 Apr 1877.  A sketch reproduced in the 1880 LdR Monograph shows GC 2633 [later NGC 3988] and a second nebula close following a star.  Dreyer assumed this was GC 2645 [later NGC 4004], but the placement with respect to the included stars matches IC 2982.

Guillaume Bigourdan "officially" discovered IC 2982 again on 28 Apr 1894.  The IC position is 3' too far south but Corwin's re-reduced position is a good match and his description fits.  Bigourdan is credited with the discovery in the IC.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 2995 = Sw XI-131 on 30 Dec 1897 and noted "vF; L; cE; 8m * near f[ollowing]; np of 2 [with Sw XI-133]."  The second entry was actually observed 2 nights later, so he may have added the comment "np of 2" when preparing his manuscript.  Howe observed the field in 1899-00 and reported, "These were discovered on different nights; their positions agree closely, and their descriptions fairly.  I examined the locality on two nights, and found only one nebula, which is elongated at 120°, is about 1.5' long, and points toward a star of mag 9, which follows 15 or 20 seconds."  So, Sw XI-133 is a duplicate entry for IC 2995.  DeLisle Stewart found this galaxy again on an Arequipa plate in 1899, measured the position, and noted "F, cL, ellip. sp form, E at 125°."

Reinmuth also questioned if NGC 4338 = IC 3247 but Malcolm Thomson feels this galaxy is too faint and would not have been visible in d'Arrest's 11-inch refractor in twilight -- I agree.  NGC 4338 is more likely a duplicate of NGC 4310 with a 1 minute error in RA.

24" (6/4/16): fairly faint to moderately bright, small, round, fairly high surface brightness, 20" diameter, fairly bright stellar nucleus.  Based on my size estimate, I only noticed the bright core region.

IC 3481 is the first of three in a linear trio (Arp 175 = Zwicky's Triplet) with IC 3481A 1.4' SE and IC 3483 5.5' SE.  IC 3481A appeared faint, small, round, 12" diameter, low surface brightness.  On deep images, IC 3481 and 3481A are connected by a tidal plume and a huge arcing tail from IC 3481A reaches about 2/3 of the way to IC 3483.  But IC 3483 has a very low recessional velocity, so a true connection of all three galaxies is very unlikely.

Royal Frost discovered IC 3481 = F. 953 on a plate taken 10 May 1904 at Harvard's Arequipa Observatory in Peru.  He noted, "bM, magn 13."

Fritz Zwicky  first discussed the interaction between this triple in his 1952 paper "Luminous Intergalactic Matter".  It was also discussed in his 1956 paper "Multiple Galaxies".  The trio is identified as "Zwicky's Triplet" in the RC2, although CGCG 252-003, called "Zwicky's Connected System" is generally given this nickname.

At 380x, the disc is concentrated to a quasi-stellar nucleus, but it was difficult to distinguish the central star due to the high surface brightness glow.  Surrounding the central region is a much fainter, round, outer shell that increases the diameter to 15"-20".  Seeing not steady enough for higher power.

Robert G. Aitken discovered IC 3568 visually on 31 Aug 1900 while examining comet Borrelly-Brooks with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory. With the 36-inch, he described this object as a nebulous star or planetary with a mag 10.5-11 central star (BD +83°.357) and a 5"-6" halo.  He noted it formed a 14.8" double (A 9001) with a mag 13 star.

Based on Crossley photographs at Lick, Curtis (1918) reported "the nucleus is surrounded by very bright matter in a disk 18" in diameter, apparently perfectly round, and fading out a little at the edges."

In the 1956 book "Gaseous Nebulae", Lawrence Aller stated the "theoretician's planetary nebula" was most closely approximated  by IC 3568.  The 1987 study "The shapes and shaping of the planetary nebulae IC 3568, NGC 40, and NGC 6543" by Balick et al adds "If IC 3568 did not exist, it might have been created by theoreticians".

Brian Skiff notes the UGC misidentification (UGC 7731) as a galaxy.  The UGC description is "Compact or *" and description "alm compl stellar on PA prints, prob extr compact gx."  Because of the misclassification in UGC, this planetary is has the galaxy designation PGC 41662, though HyperLeda now shows the object type as a planetary.

This broad arm winds counterclockwise from east to south roughly 100° with IC 3668, the brightest region or knot, near the south end of the arm, ~1.8' from the center of the bar.

William Herschel possibly discovered IC 3668 = Wolf V-2 on 9 Apr 1787 in his observation of NGC 4618.  He recorded "Two. The most north considerably or vB.  The most south pB.  Their nebulosities run into each other; the most north vmbM."  The southern object may be IC 3668, the HII complex on the south end of the galaxy .  JH also called this galaxy double.  On 12 Apr 1830 he logged, "Double; a B, L nebula, gbM, with a F one attached, 70° sf, so as to run together into one; moonlight."  JH included two GC designations, but Dreyer combined them in the NGC.

Arnold Schwassmann found IC 3672 = Sn. 213 on a plate taken by Max Wolf with a 6-inch astrograph at the Heidelberg Observatory in Sep 1900.  He noted "F, S, R, li[ke] *12."  His position (2 measures) matches IC 809 = UGC 7863, which was discovered by Swift on 6 May 1888.  Despite the earlier discovery by Swift, CGCG, UGC and MCG all identify this galaxy as IC 3672, though IC 809 should be the primary designation.

48" (4/7/13): very unusual appearance at 488x as the galaxy is dominated by a very high surface brightness HII region (Mrk 59) at the SSW end, about 15" in diameter and 13th magnitude. The knot appeared extremely bright, roundish, sharp-edged.  The main glow of the galaxy is very elongated to the NNE, 3.0'x 0.6', extending just past a mag 13 star near the opposite end.  The core is a somewhat brighter, elongated, knotty region, offset closer to the giant HII region.  The glow of the galaxy dims as it extends to the star at the opposite end and fades out just beyond.  PGC 101479, a compact galaxy, is exactly in line with the major axis of NGC 4861, 3.5' NNE of the mag 12 star.  It appeared faint or fairly faint (B = 16.8), round, 12"-15" diameter.

17.5" (1/23/93): faint, very elongated SSW-NNE, even low surface brightness.  Located between two mag 12 stars at low power.  The "star" at the SSW end is slightly nebulous at 166x and appears as a definite nonstellar knot at 332x.  UGC and CGCG misidentify this HII region as NGC 4861 (and the galaxy as IC 3961).  This is one of the few extragalactic HII regions which responds to OIII filtration.

13.1" (2/23/85): faint, elongated streak SSW-NNE.  Stretches between two 12th magnitude "stars".  The star at the south end is actually a giant HII region and it appears slightly fuzzy at 166x and clearly nonstellar at 312x.

Max Wolf found IC 3961 = W. V-103 in 1903 on a Heidelberg plate.  His postion, comments ("pL, pF, elongated in PA 30°) and note ("between two mag 12 stars") matches NGC 4861.  Harold Corwin notes that one of the mag 12 stars is the prominent HII region.  See NGC 4861.

UGC and CGCG identify the main galaxy as IC 3961 and the bright HII knot as NGC 4861 (Webb Society Quarterly Journal #45, July 1981).  Although LdR noted a "bright little knot" at the south end, the HII complex was not given a separate designation in the NGC or IC.

14" (4/4/16 - Coonabaraban, 184x): moderately bright to fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated NNW-SSE, 40"x30", small bright nucleus.  A mag 11.6 star is 1.2' NW of center, a mag 11.1 star is 2' WNW and a mag 7.9 star is 10' SE.  A 5' string of stars extends to the south-southwest.  HCG 63 lies 25' SE.

This galaxy is the brightest member of the galaxy group LGG 324, which includes three members of HCG 63 as well as ESO 443-032 (identified as IC 3986 in modern sources) 11' NE.  ESO 443-032 appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated, 35"x30", contains a small bright nucleus.  ESO 443-029, just 4.8' NE (a member of more distant AGC 3537) was very faint, small, round, 25" diameter, low surface brightness.

17.5" (5/22/93): fairly faint, small, round, weak concentration, crisp-edged.  Forms part of the "Bowl" of a "Dipper" asterism formed by an 8' group of stars mostly to the south.  HCG 63 lies 25' SE.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 3986 = Sw XI-147 on 31 Jan 1898 and reported "eeF; pS; R; 10m * nr nf."  His RA is over 1.0 minute west of ESO 443-032, which is not unusual for his discoveries during his last year of observing.  But there is no brighter star near, casting doubt on this identification.  A good candidate is ESO 443-024, which is 10' south of Swift's position and 30 seconds of RA east.  A mag 10.5 star is nearby (as well as a closer mag 11.5 star), although the closer star is north-northwest, not northeast.  Still, assuming he mixed up the direction, ESO 443-024 is somewhat brighter and a better candidate.  I suggested this identification to Harold Corwin in April 2016 and he agreed.

Dreyer used Kobold's micrometric position, but Bigourdan's observation is nearly 5 years earlier.  Thomson argues that based on prior discovery, IC 4040 should perhaps apply to Bigourdan's system, instead of the modern identification.

It appeared extremely faint and small, round, ~10" (on the SDSS image it appears larger).  The observation required averted vision and the glow was only occasionally glimpsed but the position was verified and I felt confident of the sighting.  Located 1.4° ENE of M64, the Black-Eye Galaxy.

Max Wolf discovered IC 4107 = W. VI-165, along with several other faint IC galaxies within AGC 1638, on a Heidelberg plate taken 27 Jan 1904.

48" (4/21/17): IC 4173 = NGC 4933A is the southwest component of an interacting system.  At 488x it appeared bright, fairly small, round, 15" diameter.  Strongly concentrated with a very small bright nucleus and thin halo.  A tidal tail extension (either from NGC 4933A or 4933B) juts out towards the southwest ~20".  On the east side the halo merges with NGC 4933B [centers separated by 45" SW-NE].

17.5" (5/17/90): very faint, extremely small, round.  This is the fainter southwestern component of a double system with NGC 4933B in a common halo.

Wilhelm Tempel discovered IC 4173 = Big. 315 = NGC 4933sw around 1882 with the 11-inch "Amici I" refractor near Florence, Italy.  In his fifth discovery list, he described in the narrative portion, "In case of nebula NGC 4933 I made the remark years ago: certainly double, has a bright stellar nebula south preceding, 13m in the middle; the north following is large; Distance from each other a little over 1 '. A later remark is: fine elongated nebula with two knots, the brighter one north; on the southern tip of a faint stellar nebula"

Bigourdan independently resolved the two components (Big. 315 and 316) on 16 Apr 1895 while searching for NGC 4933, but he assumed these were new objects. Bigourdan is credited with the discovery in the IC.  See NGC 4933 for this story.  RC1, NED and MCG identify the southwest component as NGC 4933A.

At 488x, NGC 4933B appeared bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 or 3:2 SW-NE, ~1.0'x0.7'.  Sharply concentrated with an intensely bright nucleus.  The north side has a sharper light cut off [due to dust].  Located 7' NE of mag 7.9 HD 113425.

17.5" (5/17/90): moderately bright, moderately large, dominated by a bright core, faint extensions 2:1 SW-NE.  Forms a contact pair with IC 4173 at the west edge in a common halo (Arp 176).

Guillaume Bigourdan discovered IC 4176 = Big. 316, along with IC 4173 = Big. 315, on 16 Apr 1895.  There is nothing near his positions for either object, but Harold Corwin found that Bigourdan misidentified his offset star.  Once corrected his position corresponds with the two components of NGC 4933, with IC 4176 the brighter and larger northeastern galaxy.

18" (7/7/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright, compact planetary was picked up by blinking with an OIII filter at 128x.  IC 4191 forms the northern vertex of a small, distinctive triangle with a mag 10.6 star 1.1' SE and a slightly fainter mag 11 star 1.6' SSW.  Excellent contrast gain of 2-3 magnitudes using the OIII filter.  Without a filter, the planetary has that distinctive bluish color of planetaries and is slightly non-stellar with an extremely high surface brightness.  At 293x a very small disc, perhaps 4"-5" in size is visible.  The magnitude appears very similar to the mag 10.6 star 1.1' SE.  Located 40' WNW of mag 4.8 Eta Muscae.

Stephane Javelle found IC 4381 = J. 3-1294, along with IC 4382, on 15 Jun 1895.  NGC 5008, discovered by d'Arrest, is probably an earlier observation.  There is nothing at d'Arrest's position, but Harold Corwin noticed that IC 4381 is exactly 1 hour of RA east.  In addition, a mag 10.5 star precedes by 1.2 seconds (as per d'Arrest), though the star is ~90" south (not north).  So, NGC 5008 = IC 4381, assuming d'Arrest made these two errors.

A number of mag 14 stars appear to huddle around the planetary including a mag 13.5 star at the west end and some additional mag 13 stars are within 2'.  Much fainter extensions or wings are just visible extending E-W from the main body with the western wing slightly more prominent (though this may be due to the superimposed star).  The wings are more obvious when a UHC filter is used.  At 293x, there are three collinear stars just off the west edge with the western extension encompassing the closest star.  The wings increase the overall dimensions to ~60"x25".

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 140x this bright bipolar planetary appeared fairly small, 20"-25" diameter with a high surface brightness and a bluish color.

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4406 = D.S. 403 = Fleming 94 in 1901 on a Harvard objective prism plate from Arequipa (1901HarCi..60....1P).  DeLisle Stewart also found this planetary on a plate taken in 1899 at Harvard's Arequipa Station, though published in 1908.  He noted "2 nebulous stars make dumb-bell, remarkable."  Finally, Robert Innes independently found it a third time while observing with the 7-inch Metz refractor of the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.  He wrote, "As seen with the 7-inch on 14 August 1901 this is a fine planetary nebula, 10th magnitude, about 20" in diameter. Examined on the same night with the 18-inch telescope, it appears dumb-bell-shaped..."  Perhaps surprisingly, this fairly bright planetary was missed by Dunlop and John Herschel.

This galaxy is not identified as IC 4461 in modern catalogues although Javelle's position points exactly at this galaxy.  There is a faint star at its edge, and although I didn't record it, perhaps it contributed to the glow.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 4461 = J. 1326, along with IC 4462 = J. 1327, on 22 Jun 1895.  There are 3 galaxies (VV 303) nearby, but his micrometric position for J. 1326 matches VV 303c = MCG +05-34-076 = PGC 52120 and his position for J. 1327 matches VV 303a = MCG +05-34-077 = PGC 52119.  This implies the Javelle missed VV 303b = MCG +05-34-078 = PGC 52123.  NED (now corrected as of 2015), PGC and HyperLeda misidentifies PGC 52119 as IC 4461 and PGC 52123 as IC 4462.  I notified Harold Corwin, Malcolm Thomson and Wolfgang Steinicke of my conclusions and they concur with my identifications.

18" (5/3/08): brightest in a very close trio (Arp 95).  At 260x it appeared faint, small, round, 25" diameter, low even surface brightness.  Located 1.3' W of a mag 12.5 star.  This galaxy is misidentified as IC 4461 in all modern catalogues.  IC 4461 lies 45" SW of center and MCG +05-34-078 is just 32" E of center!

17.5" (6/24/95): very faint, very small, round.  There is a mag 14.5 star just off the NE side 21" from center which confused the observation.  At moments, the compact core of the galaxy and the star appeared to form a faint double star.  I missed the faint extensions (arm) E-W on the POSS.  Forms a pair with NGC 5712 4.0' ESE.

Guillaume Bigourdan found IC 4470 = Big. 421 on 11 Jul 1887.  His full description (from Corwin) reads "Object which, at first sight, could be nebulous, but in which I suspect several stellar points.  It is therefore a cluster enveloped in nebulosity; it is vaguely elongated at 90 degrees and is 1' l and 40" wide."  His position is within 1' of CGCG 353-040 = PGC 51696.

While working through CH's 1802 "Fair Copy" of WH's sweeps on 10 Jun 2014, I found WH discovered this edge-on galaxy during his observation of H III-950 = NGC 5712 on 20 Dec 1797 (sweep 1074): "It is preceded by a small patch of stars which appears almost like this nebula, but more resolved."  This sounds very similar to Bigourdan's description and certainly applies to IC 4470 (Harold Corwin and Wolfgang Steinicke concur).  Wolfgang included it in his "WH Special" list of 22 Jun 2014.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x this globular has an unusual appearance as a round glow of nearly even surface brightness, ~3.5' diameter with a single brighter mag 12 star superimposed near the very center.  A brighter mag 10.5 field star is just off the south edge, 2' from the center.  IC 4499 appears similar to a large, fairly low surface brightness planetary or reflection nebula.  This observation was possible compromised by some clouds as the skies completely clouded up soon afterwards, but there was no evident resolution at this power.

This galaxy is identified as UGC 9713 in all catalogues and the equivalence with Javelle's IC 4534 was uncovered by Malcolm Thomson.

Stephane Javelle discovered IC 4534 = J. 3-1359 on 28 Jul 1903.  There is nothing at his position.  However, Malcolm Thomson found that Javelle very likely misidentified his reference star (GSC 2024:622).  Applying his offsets to this star lands on UGC 9713.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4572 = J. 3-1380 visually, probably along with IC 4569, on 29 Jan 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  His position of 15h 36m 53s +28° 25' (1889) corresponds with a group of IC galaxies (IC 4568, 4569, 4570, 4572, 4574), but is closest to IC 4572 and IC 4570.  The southeast galaxy on his simple sketch (probably IC 4572) is noted as "pF, pL, gbM, Rndish."  The northwest galaxy (either IC 4570 or IC 4569) is noted as "pS, gbM, Rndish."  The sketch of the 80x field shows a single star - probably mag 8.4 SAO 83949 = HD 140253.  If the field diameter is close to 40', then the second galaxy is more likely IC 4569 (separation of 17'), which has a higher surface brightness and was more evident in my visual observation.

Stephane Javelle found this galaxy again on 25 Jul 1895 with the 30-inch refractor at the Nice Observatory and measured an accurate position.  Barnard didn't publish his discovery or notify Dreyer directly so Javelle is credited with the discovery in the IC.

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4593 = Fleming 96 in 1907 on a Harvard objective prism plate.  Based on Crossley photographs, Curtis (1918) described, "Central star about mag 10.  This is surrounded by a disk of brighter matter 11" in diameter, fading out a little towards the edges.  There is a bright wing at the north end in pa 347°, and a smaller and fainter projection opposite this; fainter matter outside brings the whole diameter to about 15"."

18" (7/12/10): immediately noticed at 108x while viewing Barnard 41 (about 15' NE). ?This large reflection nebula (part of Rho Ophiuchi complex) contains two bright, striking pairs at 47" (SHJ 225 = 7.4/8.1) and 13" (SHJ 226 = 7.6/8.4).  Both of these pairs are encased within a large, obvious hazy glow with an irregular, elongated shape oriented NW-SE.  The glow was faintly visible in my 80mm finder at 13x.

13.1" (7/5/83): appears as a large, slightly milky and starless region involving two pretty double stars (SHJ 225 = 7.4/8.1 at 47" and SHJ 226 = 7.6/8.3 at 13") and a single star to the west.  This triangular region appears "lighter" than the surrounding background with a Deep Sky filter.  The north side has a more definite edge.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4601 on a plate taken 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.  He noted two bright BD stars (the latter is HD 147103) "to be strongly involved in diffused nebulosity which is slightly elongated np and sf."  DeLisle Stewart found the nebulosity again on an Arequipa plate taken in 1898 and reported D.S. 431 as "B, eL, nebulous wisps, involves AGC 22138-39 and 22150-1; extends 1m in RA and 12' in Dec."

17.5" (6/30/00): this is a large, circular glow surrounding a 4' pair of mag 8/10 stars and is part of the Rho Ophiuchi complex (2° north of Antares).  The nebulosity extends roughly 8'-10' in diameter.  The setting is quite eerie as the 50' field is nearly devoid of all stars - just two other faint stars and the field has a dull gray appearance as if it was weakly luminous.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4603, along with IC 4604, around 1883, probably with his 5" refractor.  In his 1895 paper "On a great photographic nebula near Antares", he stated "for fully ten or twelve years I have known of a vast region of nebulosity in Scorpius near Antares."  In addition he referred to a note made 15 June 1892, "A couple of years ago [at Lick Observatory] I found 2 stars involved in a very large diffused nebulosity.  They are strongly nebulous in the 6.5" and in the 12", but are best seen in the 6.5".  The stars are about 8.5 and 9.5 mag, the following star being the brighter.  They are 1.8° north and 42' preceding Antares [apparently IC 4603].  This region and preceding it for some distance seems to consist of a vast but very diffused nebulosity."  At Lick he took an image of region on 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory. He noted "the brighter and more complicated portions of the nebula center about Rho Ophiuchi, 22 Scorpii and a couple of small stars occupying the center of the equilateral triangle formed by Rho Oph, 22 and Sigma Scorpii."  The "couple of small stars occupying the center" are involved with IC 4603.

The glow appears most evident around the bright star.  The dusty surrounding field (Barnard 42) is nearly empty of stars.

E.E. Barnard visually discovered IC 4604, the Rho Ophiuchi Nebula, around 1883, probably with his 5" refractor.  See notes on IC 4603.

Caroline Herschel, in a letter to her son John, mentioned she "once heard your father, after a long awful silence, exclaim "Hier ist wahrhaftig ein Loch im Himmel! [Here is truly a hole in the heavens!]".  She urged John to search for region in the lower part of Scorpion as William returned to it several nights over several years.  In Joseph Ashbrook's "Astronomical Scrapbook", he concludes this remark apparently refers to the Rho Ophiuchi region, although an internet search shows the quote is sometimes attributed to Barnard 86.

Barnard 44 is a huge dark lane that extends roughly 6° ENE.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4605 on a plate taken 23 Mar 1895 with the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4628 between 1892 and 1895 on a plate taken at Lick Observatory.  In Lick Publications Vol 11, 1913, Plate 37 he describes: "The coarse cluster in 16h 48m, -40.3° does not seem to be in Dreyer's lists.  It is a very interesting objects and appears to be connected by a scattering chain of stars, with the cluster [NGC] 6231 south of it.  In its northern part is the nebula IC 4628.  This was originally discovered on a plate with the Willard lens, but no announcement was made of it.  It is a large nebula one half degree in diameter and of irregular form and brightness.  A photograph with the 10-inch Bruce telescope at Mount Wilson in 1905 (June 21) shows the irregular group of stars and the nebula very beautifully.  There are still fainter portions that extend half a degree to the northeast.  The nebulosity, apparently, does not condense about any one of the stars and is probably not actually connected with the cluster."  Royal Harwood Frost also found IC 4628 = F. 1148 on a photographic place taken in 1903 at Harvard's Arequipa station and both are credited in the IC.

At 450x, the high surface brightness 8" disc has an irregular outline and is surrounded by a thin, very faint envelope that increases the diameter to ~12".  In moments of better seeing, a very faint central star emerges within the high surface brightness glow.  A distinctive right triangle of mag 12-13 stars follows (closest star is 1.3' due east).

18" (7/22/06): picked up at 225x as a bright, small, blue disc of very high surface brightness.  Good contrast gain using the UHC filter.  Appears much brighter than the similar mag 11 star using the filter.  At 435x, the planetary is slightly elongated N-S, ~10"x8" with strong flash of a central star.

11" (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): first noticed in 10x30 IS binoculars while looking at NGC 6352 as an obvious knot 1.5 degrees to the south.  At 127x, I was surprised to find a beautifully rich open cluster with over 100 stars mag 10-13.5 in at least a 15' field.  The stars are fairly uniform in distribution with a weak central concentration, though several form loops and chains around blank areas.  The brightest mag 9 star is on the east side. This is an intermediate-age cluster (~2 billion years old).  Located one degree west of mag 2.8 Alpha Arae.

James Dunlop discovered IC 4651= D 402 on 28 Jul 1826 and described "a very fine round cluster of very small stars, slightly compressed to the centre, about 8' diameter."  His position is on the south side of the cluster, so the identification is certain.

Solon Bailey rediscovered the cluster on a photographic plate in 1896 using a 1" lens at the Arequipa station.  The discovery was reported in "A Catalogue of Bright Clusters and Nebulae" (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No. VIII, 1908).  Bailey was credited with the discovery in the IC as John Herschel didn't confirm Dunlop's observation.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this irregular galaxy has a disrupted appearance or perhaps is interacting with a companion.  The structure is difficult to separate but the brighter component on the northeast side is moderately bright, small, elongated WNW-ESE.  Attached on the south side is a larger, but fainter extension oriented nearly perpendicular to the brighter component.  A faint star is at the edge.  IC 4662 is located just 10' NE of mag 3.7 Eta Pavonis and the bright star interferes with viewing if left in the field.

According to the article "Star formation in the irregular galaxy IC 4662" (A&A, 1990, 234, 99) the elongated knot on the northeast side contains two giant HII regions comparable to the 30 Doradus complex!  IC 4662 is identical to He 2-269 (PK 328-17.1), which Karl Henize included in a 1967 list of planetary nebulae discovered through H-alpha emission on objective prism plates.  In a 1970 paper, Pastoriza gave the classification as a nearby dwarf emission line galaxy with a radial velocity of ~400 km/sec (less than 10 million l.y.).

Robert Innes discovered IC 4662 visually in 1901 with the 7-inch Merz refractor at the Cape of Good Hope.  He noted "a faint oval nebula 1' in diameter, N.p. Eta Pavonis.  Found with the 7-inch."  Based on plates taken at Arequipa, DeLisle Stewart noted "F, S, irr, 2 st. inv."  Stewart referenced Innes' discovery announcement in MN 62, 470.

Located close 30" SW of a mag 12 star and 2' ENE of a mag 10 star.  The mag 12 star forms the western vertex of a small trapezoid of mag 11-12 stars with sides 1'-2'.  At 73x this planetary shares the same field, 45' N of NGC 6520 and ultra dark B86.

At 323x the western side was perhaps slightly brighter.  Located 45' N of Barnard 86/NGC 6520.  A very faint planetary, M 2-26, lies 8' NNW.

48" (4/1/11): IC 4677 appeared as a prominent, triangular or wedge-shaped knot with the vertex pointing east, situated 1.8' due west of center near the edge of the outer halo. It appeared much larger than previously seen, ~50"x30", and brighter along a well-defined, straight southern edge.  The north side is brightest near the east end at the vertex.  A 15th magnitude star lies 45" NE and a mag 9.8 star is 1.2' NW.  A second fainter (uncatalogued) knot in the outer halo is located 2.6' ESE of center, just 30" N of a mag 14.5 star.  This knot was only 15"-20" in size and had a low surface brightness.

18" (6/20/04): easily visible at 160x using a UHC filter as a slightly elongated, low surface brightness glow 1.7' W of center of NGC 6543 and 1.5' SE of a mag 11 star which lies 2.7' WNW of NGC 6543.  This shock-excited knot in the outer halo was elongated 3:2 SW-NE, roughly 20"x13".  At 225x it was barely visible unfiltered, but could be held continuously at this power adding a UHC filter.

17.5" (6/3/00): at 140x with a UHC filter, this ionized knot in the outer halo of the Cat's Eye was faint but clearly visible as a low surface brightness arc, located just south of the midpoint of the line connecting the geometric center of the PN with a mag 11 star 2.7' NW.

17.5" (11/1/97): this unusual object is a irregular knot in the outer halo of NGC 6543 1.7' W of center and appearing visually completely detached from the bright planetary.  Suspected at 220x without filtration close to a mag 15 star located 1' NW of the planetary.  Using a UHC filter, IC 4677 is clearly visible with averted vision as a very faint elongated patch, ~25"x15" oriented SW-NE.  Requires averted for a good view but can almost hold continuously.  Also visible at 140x with OIII filter and 280x with the UHC, but 220x provided the best view.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4677 on 24 Apr 1900 with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor.  Harold Corwin comments that Vorontsov-Velyaminov "included it in his first list [1959] of interacting galaxies (where it is No. 121), and in the MCG (it is MCG +11-22-017).  This is a bit surprising as VV was an early authority on planetary nebulae; his book from the 1930's is now something of a classic on the topic.  Still, the object does look something like a distorted late barred spiral on the PSS prints."  IC 4677 is now known to be a shock-excited knot (or FLIER) in the halo of IC 4677.

Somewhat difficult at low power to identify with certainty due to location in a rich Milky Way field and the nearby nebulous glow from M8.  Better at 140x-220x, where a fairly obvious 3' glow is visible.  No noticeable improvement with filters.

13.1" (8/17/85): a thin dark "finger" extends towards the cluster, positioned just south and beyond the two bright mag 9 stars near the center.  This is an extension of the wider projection seen previously several times and which is better defined along the south edge.

13.1" (8/15/82): the "Eagle Nebula" is a fairly bright 30' nebulosity in a striking outstretched eagle shape with a bright scattered cluster superimposed.  There is a considerable contrast gain to the nebulosity using a UHC or OIII filter.  With a UHC filter, a dark projection (called the "Star Queen") enters on the southeast edge of the nebula and extends inward to the west. The cluster members surrounding the "head" of the eagle include ten mag 8-10 stars and a bright pair of mag 8.5 stars (8.2/8.8 at 27").  A dark triangular wedge is visible off the north side.

13.1" (5/26/84): the dark protrusion was fairly easy at 88x.

Isaac Roberts found IC 4703, the nebulosity involved in M16, on a photograph taken with his 20" reflector in 1894.  Although De Chéseaux discovered M16 between 1745-46, he only mentioned a star cluster and even William Herschel just described the stars using his 12-inch reflector: "Large stars with small ones among them; within a small compass I counted more than 50, and there must be at least 100 without taking a number of straggling ones, everywhere dispersed in the neighborhood."  Roberts is credited with the discovery in the IC, but Steinicke notes in his book on the history of the NGC that Etienne Trouvelot made a visual discovery in 1876 with the USNO 26-inch refractor.  Trouvelot mentions "..described by Sir J. Herschel as a loose cluster of at least 100 stars, I have found to be involved in an extensive, although not very bright, nebula, which seems to have escaped his scrutiny.  In a study and drawing of this nebula made in 1876, its general form is that of an open fan, with the exception that handle is wanting, with deeply indented branches on the preceding side, where the brightest stars of the cluster are grouped.  From this peculiar form, this object might be appropriately be called the Fan Nebula."

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4706 and 4707 photographically in Jul/Aug 1905  using the 10-inch Bruce telescope at Mt. Wilson.  In describing the region surrounding M17 = Swan Nebula (see AN 4239), he wrote, "Preceding the brightest portion of the nebula, by about 15', are two small stars involved in a small nebulosity.  These stars are BD -16°4812 [IC 4706] and -16°4813 [IC 4707] of the 9.2 and 9.4 magnitudes."  Harold Corwin notes that Barnard misidentified the BD stars, which should read BD -16°4811 [IC 4706] and -16°4812 [IC 4707].  As a result the IC positions are in error (particularly for IC 4707).

Charles Messier "discovered" M24 = "Small Sagittarius Star Cloud" = IC 4715  telescopically on 20 Jun 1764, although it is of course a prominent naked-eye object.  E.E. Barnard photographed the region in 1905 and described in AN 4239 ("Some notes on nebulae and nebulosities"), "The magnificent star cloud...is remarkable for the definiteness and angularity of its south and following outlines.  The east side is about 42' long and is very straight.  The south side is somewhat irregular and much longer.  The run south preceding for about 90' and then joins the great bed of nebulous matter just described.  The northern edge of this star cloud is diffused.  In the cloud towards its northern edge, are two remarkable black holes..."   His position, though, was 10 min of RA too large, so Dreyer didn't recognize it as M24.  Brent Archinal caught the error and made the equivalence (see Corwin's identification notes).  WH apparently first observed M24 on 2 Aug 1783 with his 12-inch and noted "considerable stars in great number."

Burnham's "Celestial Handbook", MOL (Master Optical List) and the NGC 2000.0 catalogue (Sinnott) misclassify this galaxy as a planetary nebula.

The first and most famous in this paper being the "Fine Ring Nebula" Shapley 1 in Norma and this object is Shapley 5.  Evans and Thackeray (1950) state "We find (Plate II, Fig. 20) a curious round object of diameter about 19" with three distinct nuclei running along a north-south line across it. The designation as a planetary again seems doubtful."

17.5" (7/26/95): overfills 50' field with 20 Nagler.  Contains roughly 70 stars brighter than mag 11 and too many faint stars to count.  There are two mag 6.5 stars near the northwest and southeast ends of the cluster (the latter star is not physical member) at the edges of the field (46' separation).  There are no rich subgroups or central concentration but many stars are arranged in long chains and curving loops.  The most prominent is a long chain oriented NW-SE through the center.  Visible as a naked-eye patch at the edge of the Milky Way.

Solon Bailey found IC 4756 in 1896 on a plate taken with a 1" Cooke lens at the Arequipa station in Peru (Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol LX, No VIII, 1908) and is credited with the discovery in the IC2.  But it was discovered visually by Reverend Thomas Webb by 1859 with his 3.7" Tully refractor.  In the listing for NGC 6633 in his "Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes" (1859) Webb wrote, "Between it [NGC 6633] and Theta, nearer the former, is a beautiful large cloud of stars, chiefly 8 or 9 mag., a nearer part, apparently, of the Galaxy: visible to the naked-eye, and requiring a large field."  The nickname "Graff's Cluster" comes from German astronomer Kasimir Graff, who independently discovered it in 1922.

17.5" (8/2/97): this galaxy is located just 2.0' following a mag 6 star (HD 174262) and the view is severely hampered by the bright star!  At 220x, this object is visible as a very faint and small, round disc, ~15" in diameter.  A better view was at 420x with the 4.8 Nagler where the unconcentrated galaxy is well separated from the bright star.  When the bright star exited the field the galaxy was quite easy to view due to its relatively high surface brightness.

Sherbourne Burnham discovered IC 4791 visually on 4 Jun 1889 with the 36-inch Lick refractor.  Burnham measured micrometric offsets from the nearby bright star (Lalande 35032 = HD 174262) in 1899 at Yerkes (Publ of Yerkes Obs, Vol 1, p296).  

On the DSS, this object appears to be a fairly bright compact galaxy (confirmed by Brian Skiff on POSS 2), though it is not listed in any modern catalogue except for LEDA 1588608. The IC description "Neb;* 6 f 2’" should read "* 6 p 2’".

Burnham discovered IC 4867 on 21 Jun 1901 at Yerkes Observatory while measuring the separation and position angle of nearby O∑ 182.  This galaxy was probably discovered earlier by Lewis Swift on 15 Apr 1890, but his position was 50' too far south.

There is nothing at Swift's position for either of these two entries.  Harold Corwin suggests that Swift's made an 18 minute error in time (too small).  Once corrected, his position falls very close to Shapley-Ames 5 (New 5) = ESO 285-007.  In addition, his description fits using three or four stars close east.  Using the same correction for Sw XII-16, IC 4948 is a duplicate of NGC 6902.  Strangely, Swift listed the discovery date for IC 4948 as 17 Sep 1897 (6 nights later). See that number for more.  Malcolm Thomson also has a comprehensive summary of the situation.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 4954, along with IC 4955, on 9 Jun 1888 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He noted, "the north nebula [IC 4954] is not so well defined [as the south one] - that is the star is not.  The star may be double, there is a faint star or separate patch (definition too bad to decide) close s.f.  If the star is double, the components will be nearly n and s but not quite."  He also viewed these reflection nebulae on 15 and 29 Jun, as well as 25 Jul 1888.

Forms a pair with ESO 340-13 2.7' E (not seen at a low viewing elevation).  The identification of this galaxy with IC 4991 is possible, though unlikely.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 4991 = Sw XI-191 on 23 Sep 1897 and reported, "vF; cS; R; no bright star near".  There is nothing near his position.  The nearest bright galaxy is ESO 340-011, identified as IC 4991 in the ESO-Uppsala catalogue (and followed by PGC, RC3, NED, NGC 2000.0 etc.).  This galaxy is located 32' north of Swift's position and 37 seconds of RA east.  But a mag 9.5 star is 5' NW as well as a mag 8.3 star less than 9' N.  Although Swift's positions are notoriously poor in his final observing years, the two bright nearby stars in his field  makes this identification unlikely.  Still it is certainly bright enough to have been picked up by Swift, so it remains a possibility.

18" (8/14/04): beautiful open cluster at 225x with perhaps three dozen stars resolved in fairly poor seeing.  Appears small, but rich and quite elongated SSW-NNE, ~4'x2'.  Includes three bright mag 8.5-9.5 stars (ADS 13626) forming an obtuse isosceles triangle with the brightest star at the vertex.  A 4th fainter star to the west forms a trapezoid with this trio.  Two of the stars in the triangle are close, unequal doubles (including ?422, 9.7/10.8 at 4") and the single star has a 13th magnitude close pair nearby!  The remainder of the stars in the cluster are generally mag 13 and fainter.  There are sprays of stars to the north and south giving the elongated appearance.  Located 1.1° SE of the Crescent Nebula and 1.7° SW of M29.

William Herschel discovered IC 4996 on 20 Sep 1786 (sweep 594) and recorded, "Clustering stars the place taken is pretty much condensed, and contains 3 pS stars close together".  He didn't assign an internal discovery number or H-designation, so this observation went unpublished, but Wolfgang Steinicke found that his offset in time and PD from 6th magnitude 34 Cygni (the next object in the sweep) matches this cluster.  Steinicke also notes that soon after in the sweep he encountered M29, and just noted a "Clustering large stars" again without assigning a number.

According to Steinicke, Hugo Clemens "noticed the object on a plate taken [13 Jun 1896] for the Photographische Himmelskarte with a 10.5" f/10.5 astrograph at Potsdam Observatory."  The IC credit went to Frank Bellamy, who independently discovered IC 4996 on a plate taken 13 Jun 1896 with the 13" astrograph at Radcliff Observatory in Oxford.  The discovery was announced in the paper "A New Cluster in Cygnus", MNRAS 64, 662 (1904).  Bellamy didn't state a position for the cluster and Dreyer's estimated position is ~25'  too far north.

A 12th mag star 2' WSW completes a distinctive obtuse triangle.  With the filter the PN is nearly one magnitude brighter than the 10th mag star.  At 280x, the PN is bluish and a tiny disc was highly suspected, perhaps 2"-3".

Williamina Fleming discovered IC 4997 = Fleming 97 in 1896 during an examination of stars with unusual spectra on a Harvard objective prism plate.  The discovery was reported by Pickering in the Harvard College Observatory, Circular No.9 in July 1896.  According to Wolfgang Steinicke, Gustav Gruss independently visually discovered IC 4997 around 1896, using a 6" or 8" refractor with the aid of a spectroscope, so both deserve discovery credit.

Based on Crossley photographs taken at Lick, Heber Curtis (1918) reported IC 4997 was "indistinguishable from a star on the Crossley negatives, but shown to have a minute disk visually with the 36-inch."

Lewis Swift found IC 5039 = Sw XI-197, along with IC 5041 = Sw XI-199, on 29 Aug 1897 and recorded "vF; pS; R; 2 F st near nf point to it; 1st of 3."

Remarkably, this was the 3rd out of 4 times he "discovered" this pair in the summer of 1897 at the age of 77.  His first observation of the pair, Sw XI-200 (later IC 5046) and Sw XI-201 (later IC 5047) was on 9 Jun 1897.  IC 5046 was described as "eF; pS; vE; eeF * and vF * near sf, point to it; sp of 2.", while IC 5047 says "eeF; pS; vE; 8m * 31' n; v diff; nf of 2."  His RA for both are about 1.5 minutes too large and his dec is 3' too far south, but his description fits.  He found the pair again on 26 Jul 1897 and recorded Sw XII-22 (later IC 5029) and Sw XII-23 (later IC 5030), but his RA was 3 minutes too small, and the dec for IC 5030 10' too far south.  The 4th observation was recorded as Sw XII-18 (later IC 5003) and XII-19 (later IC 5007) on 8 Sep 1897 and this time his RA was 18 minutes too small!  Once again, the description of the field clinches this identification (uncovered by Harold Corwin).  As a result, IC 5003 = IC 5029 = IC 5039 = IC 5046 and IC 5007 = IC 5030 = IC 5041 = IC 5047.  The IC positions for 5039 and 5041 are from Howe and very accurate, though IC 5046 and 5047 refer to Swift's first observation of the pair.

18" (9/25/06): I viewed the IC 5068 complex using a 20mm Nagler (113x) with an OIII filter or UHC filter.  To the northwest of IC 5068 is an obvious second large patch of nebulosity that is generally designated IC 5068B (though possibly equal to IC 5067).  This piece is very large and elongated NW to SE, extending perhaps 40'x15'.  It contains a bright circular 10' patch to the south of mag 8.2 SAO 50061.  A broad river of faint nebulosity streams away towards the northwest from this brighter region.

Thomas Espin discovered IC 5067 visually, along with IC 5068 and 5070, on 7 Sep 1899 with his 17 1/4-inch reflector. He simply noted "faint" and there is nothing at his position, about 37' W of the neck of the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070).  Harold Corwin suggests that if Espin's declination was off by 1.5°, then IC 5067 corresponds with IC 5068B, described here.  Espin's positions for IC 5068 and 5070 are good, so IC 5067 is lost without additional information, but Corwin notes that IC 5068B is the brightest nebula in the region that he might have picked up.

18" (9/25/06): IC 5068 is the second of three very large emission nebulae roughly one degree south of the southern end of the Pelican Nebula.  At 113x and an OIII filter, this object appears very large, diffuse, irregular glow, roughly 25'x20'.  It is noticeably brighter in a 12' circular region about 10' N of a mag 7.3 star (HD 198690) and a group of brighter stars that are near the southeast side of the nebula.

To the northwest is a second large patch of nebulosity, generally designated IC 5068B, though if Espin's declination was off by 1.5°, this may be IC 5067.  This piece is very large and elongated NW to SE, extending perhaps 40'x15'.  It contains a bright circular 10' patch to the south of a mag 8 star (SAO 50061).  A broad river of faint nebulosity streams away towards the northwest from this brighter region.

To the east of IC 5068 is the least conspicuous section, dubbed IC 5068C.  This detached piece extends 30'x15' (elongated E-W) and overall has a low surface brightness appearing as a hazy glow.  A mag 6.7 star is at the southwest end and a mag 7 star is at the eastern edge.

Reverend Thomas Espin discovered IC 5068, along with IC 5070, visually on 7 Sep 1899 with a 17 1/4-inch reflector at his Tow Law observatory in England. He simply noted "very faint", but his position is only 6' NW of center of this very large, parallelogram-shaped nebula, so the identification is fairly certain.

Discovered by Espin (AN 3633).  Described simply as "very faint".  The Pelican Nebula is also announced in this short list of 6 objects.  His discovery position is 1 tmin W of the Sky Catalogue 2000.0 position!

18" (7/17/07): The huge Pelican Nebula overfilled the 67' field in the 31 Nagler.  The UHC filter gave a higher contrast than the OIII filter.  Several brighter sections were noted on the close-up chart A1 in the U2000 atlas.  One of the brightest pieces is the "neck" of the Pelican located 20'-25' W of mag 4.8 57 Cygni and collinear with two mag 8/9 stars 10' and 12' due west.  The glow extends 10' in length.  To the SW of the mag 4.8 star is the large "beak" section that streams from NW to SE and extends roughly 20'x8', widening a bit at the SE end.  The west side of the beak is defined by a dark lane that parallels the nebulosity and the large, faint body of the Pelican is west of this lane and includes 5.1-magnitude 56 Cygni (the nebulosity is very weak here).  The brightest section of the body is a large, circular patch at the south end, ~12' diameter, and located 30' SE of 56 Cygni and 55' S of the "neck".

18" (9/25/06): This was the first observation of the Pelican Nebula in quite awhile and I forgot about this huge, interesting emission nebula.  The view was fascinating at 113x with an OIII or UHC filter as this object overfilled the 44' field.  I started exploring to the west of 4.8-magnitude 57 Cygni.  The brightest section is possibly on a line with this star and a mag 7.2 star further east and corresponds with the neck portion on the Pelican.  This is where the ionization front is most evident on photographs.  The elongated "beak" of the Pelican also begins to the west of the bright star and streams off in a wide river of nebulosity towards the southeast and passing out of the field.  A long darker lane apparently free of nebulosity isolates the "neck" from the main body of the Pelican.  The irregular body spreads out to the south of the neck well beyond the southern edge of the eyepiece field and extends at least 65' from the neck terminating at the SE end with a roundish bright patch of nebulosity ~12' in diameter.  The Pelican is located directly west of the North American Nebula and part of the same huge complex of nebulosity in this region (separated by the dark cloud LDN 935).

13.1" (7/5/83): the entire body of the "Pelican" is easily visible at 62x and a UHC filter.  The "head and neck" section is easy to view along with the fainter "bill" and a long body extending from head.  Located west of the North America Nebula in a rich field between two mag 7 stars.

8" (6/22/81): faint, surrounding scattered group of stars at 50x and UHC filter.  Appears as a bright patch to the west of two bright stars (neck section).

Reverend Thomas Espin discovered IC 5070, along with IC 5068, visually on 7 Sep 1899 with a 17 1/4-inch reflector at his Tow Law observatory in England. The discovery was included in a short list of 6 new objects (including the Cocoon Nebula) in AN 3633 and noted as "faint and diffused".  His position corresponds with the "neck" of the Pelican, the brightest part of the nebula, so the identification is certain.

Max Wolf photographed the region surrounding the North American Nebula on 1 Jun 1891 (AN?3048) on a 3 hour plate. He gives a general description of the region with no specific positions, though mentions strong nebulosity was recorded around the stars 56 and 57 Cygni, which are involved in the Pelican Nebula.  So, certainly it was captured on his early image.  Espin is credited with the discovery in the IC2, but Wolf should share credit.

Forms the fainter component (V = 11.5) of a "double star" with a mag 10 star 21" ENE, but with the filter the planetary dominates the star.  Interestingly, there is similar double (Es 1339 = 10.8/11.5 at 24") in terms of separation and position angle ~3' NE!  Without a filter at 175x, IC 5117 has a soft, bluish appearance.  Using 450x, a very small 2" disc was clearly visible but it was too small to resolve any structure.

13.1" (8/7/85): appears as mag 11.5 "star" without a filter.  Forms a 20" double with a mag 10 star just east.  Using an OIII filter the planetary is brighter than the star by one magnitude (contrast gain of roughly 2.5 magnitudes).

17.5" (10/17/98): IC 5132 and IC 5133 refers to faint nebulosity surrounding a pair of mag 12 stars at 1' separation situated ~5' NNW of NGC 7129 (same complex of reflection nebulae).  It was difficult to verify with certainty as the background sky around six stars arranged in two parallel rows each ~2' in length appears to be weakly glowing.  IC 5132 and 5133 are surrounding the two stars closest to NGC 7129 and the background glow does appear very slightly enhanced around these stars.

Isaac Roberts discovered IC 5132 and 5133 on a photograph taken 25 Sep 1895 of NGC 7129. He described "there are three star, each about 13th magnitude, surrounded by very faint nebulosity in the positions following, measured from the centre of the tristellar nucleus of the nebula: (1) 358" north following; (2) 326" north preceding; (3) north preceding.  The stars Nos. 2 and 3 are not referred to in Dr. Dreyer's catalogues, and the measurements given above are approximate.  His offsets identify the two stars given here, although Dreyer's positions are offset to the southwest.  Roberts' first object didn't make it into the IC as Dreyer apparently thought it was identical to NGC 7133.

CGCG 427-040, just 2.7' ENE, appeared extremely to very faint, small, round, 20" diameter, low even surface brightness.  CGCG 427-040 is misidentified as IC 5144 in MCG, PGC and HyperLeda.  UGC 11845 lies 4.6' ESE.  This difficult edge-on (B = 16.1) appeared extremely faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~20"x10", very low surface brightness! A mag 13 star lies 1.3' SE.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5144, along with IC 5145, on 30 Jul 1888 and described in his notebook, "1 outer radius + 1 thickness [of Ring micrometer] = 7' 17" south and 17 seconds +/- preceding this nebula [IC 5145] is a small faint neb close preceding several small stars." Dreyer was notified privately of both of these discoveries.  Very close to Barnard's offset from IC 5145 is the brightest galaxy of 4 within 3', which matches his description. MCG, PGC, and HyperLeda (as of late 2015) misidentify CGCG 427-040 as IC 5144 (though has an uncertain symbol).  See Harold Corwin's notes for more.

It was found after comet-seeking "in the field and s.p. an 8th magnitude star [mag 7.7 HD 208277]."

Size 12'x12'

17.5" (8/8/91): at 82x using an H-Beta filter, the Cocoon Nebula appears fairly bright, very large, about 10' diameter.  Surrounds six stars including two bright mag 9-10 stars embedded near the center and at the south edge.  Has an irregular round shape with a very irregular surface brightness with dark mottling and brighter regions.  The nebula is quite prominent using an H-Beta filter, which gives an excellent contrast gain (higher than OIII). The nebulous glow is superimposed on a scattered star group and is situated at the east end of long dark lane = B168 which extends 1° WNW! (excellent in binoculars).  There is a distinctive edge to the Milky Way on the north edge of lane.

8" (8/12/83): about 20 stars over a very faint "milky" region, fairly large, just slightly higher contrast than Milky Way background.  A short arc of stars is off the west edge.  A long starless dark lane extends west.  Two bright stars oriented N-S are just east.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5146 = Cocoon Nebula on a photograph taken 11 Oct 1893 using the 6" Willard lens at Lick Observatory.  Max Wolf also photographed the field on 28 Jul 1894 with the 6-inch camera at K?nigstuhl.  Wolf announced his discovery with a photograph taken on 10 Jul 1904 and discussed the dark lane (Barnard 168) and nebulosity in detail in his paper "Remarkable nebula in Cygnus" (MNRAS, 64, 838,1904).

Mary Clerke, who was in correspondence with Wolf at the time, includes Wolf's 1904 photograph (plate XX) in her second edition (1905) of "The System of the Stars". ?She labeled the photograph "The Cocoon Nebula in Cygnus" and writes (p. 352) "The depicted nebula, which had been discovered ten years previously, is about 10' in diameter, of a round shape, and a complex structure. ?"It is placed centrally," Dr. Wolf writes, "in a very fine lacuna void of faint stars, which surrounds the luminous cloud like a trench." ?Moreover, this negative "halo forms the end of a long channel, running eastward from the western nebulous clouds and their lucanae, to a length of more the two degrees." ?The coexistence in the same sidereal district of nebulae and stars could not well be asserted with stronger emphasis than by clearly of a dark fosse for the accommodation of the cocoon-like object in Plate XX."  I tracked down the nickname after a discussion on AMASTRO in August 2015.

The Reverend Thomas Espin discovered the nebula visually on 13 Aug 1899 and described object #6 in AN [3633] 152, 141 as a "large, faint glow about 8', well seen each night [2]."  Espin and Wolf is credited with the discovery in the IC.

Dave Riddle notes that B168 could apply to both the bright nebula and the associated dark lane. Barnard refers to a "small nebula at the E end of dark lane. This nebula is 10' in diameter with over a dozen stars of different magnitudes in it. There is no central condensation, nor does the nebula condense about any of the stars. There are some dark markings in it. The dark lane is 1.7 degrees long and 9' wide."

48" (10/23/14): beautiful, large annular planetary at 375x, round, roughly 2' diameter, with a relatively thick annulus and a 30" central dark hole.  Contains a very easy central star, which seems brighter than mag 16.5.  The annulus is mottled and irregular in brightness.  A 60° arc along the NW portion of the annulus is slightly brighter and a 90° arc from SE to NE is much brighter and a little thicker.  A mag 10.5 star is off the SSW side (1.9' from center), but there are no superimposed stars.

18" (8/30/08): viewed from Lake Sonoma at a very low elevation, though in a dark portion of the southern sky.  Beautiful view at 115x using an OIII filter as a 2' annular ring with a relatively thick rim and 30" central hole.  A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW side (1.8' from the center).

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, this beautiful planetary appears as a large round ring, nearly 2' diameter, with a bright, thick annulus that is irregularly lit.  The rim is slightly brighter and thicker along the SE side and also appeared slightly enhanced on the NW side.  The central hole appears 25"-30" diameter and is dark except for a central star that was intermittently visible with averted vision at 228x unfiltered, although it is listed with a magnitude of 16.5!  Good contrast enhancement with a UHC filter.  A mag 10.5 is off the SSW side, 1.8' from the center.

17.5" (10/30/99): Even at -39° declination, this moderately large planetary is a beautiful annular ring at 100x with an OIII filter.  Appears round, ~100" diameter, the annulus has an irregular surface brightness.  The central "hole" is perhaps 25" in diameter and fairly dark.  A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW edge.

17.5" (8/20/88): perfect annular 2' ring visible at 82x using an OIII filter.  A mag 10.5 star is just off the SSW edge 1.8' from the center.  The ring-shape is clearly visible with direct vision.

17.5" (7/22/87): beautiful ring at 140x with an OIII filter.  Appears fairly large, fairly bright with a mag 11 star off the south edge.

13.1" (8/17/85): fairly faint with OIII at 79x, fairly large.  Appears clearly annular with averted vision.  The central hole is possibly elongated N-S. A mag 11 star is off the south edge.  Similar view on 7/20/85.

Walter Gale, an amateur from Sydney, discovered IC 5150 on 4 Jun 1894 with his 8.5-inch reflector from Paddington and it was reported in the B.A.A. Vol VI, No. 5 (p218) in 1895.  He found it just visible in a 6-inch reflector and a 5-inch refractor.  Using his new 10-inch reflector, he noted that it spanned 45"x35" N-S with the central vacancy less than half the diameter and not entirely dark.  He also commented it was remarkable that such a relatively bright object was overlooked by JH.

Lewis Swift independently found this planetary on 23 July 1897 on Echo Mountain in southern California and recorded XII-29 as "vF, L, lE, 2 B st point to it, nearest in contact."  Swift's position for XII-29 = IC 5148 was 30 sec of RA too small.  By priority, the primary designation should be IC 5150 (from Gale), although it is generally known as IC 5148 or IC 5148-50.  Baracchi observed it using the Great Melbourne Telescope and described the planetary as almost circular, ~1.5' diameter, not quite dark in the central portion.

It's very surprising that John Herschel missed this galaxy as it is quite large and relatively prominent.  Gradually concentrated to a brighter 45" core.

30" (10/9/15 - OzSky): at 394x; very bright, large, very elongated 4:1 WSW-ENE, 2.0'x0.5', narrow lens shape, sharply concentrated with a small, intense core.  NGC 7232A lies 8.2' NNE and IC 5171 is 25' WSW.  IC 5181 is a member of the NGC 7213 group, which includes NGC 7232, 7233 and IC 5170, among others.

NGC 7232A appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly large. thin edge-on 5:1 WNW-ESE, 1.6'x0.3', weakly concentrated with no defined core.  A mag 8.5 star (HD 210796) lies just 2.4' SE, nearly along the direction of the major axis, and detracts a bit from viewing.  In addition, mag 7.7 HD 210795 is also in the field 5.6' NNE!

13.1" (8/11/85): moderately bright, elongated spiral with bulging brighter core and fainter extensions SW-NE.  Located 14' SSW of mag 7.6 SAO 231040 and 8.6' SW of mag 8.5 SAO 231041.  Surprisingly bright for an IC galaxy and easily visible for so low an elevation from Northern California.

Joseph Lunt discovered IC 5181 visually around 1900, during a search for Brorsen's Comet with the 18-inch f/15 refractor at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.  IC 5181 is generally attached to ESO 289-001 = PGC 68317, though Lunt's RA is nearly 1 minute greater and his declination 7' further north, closer to fainter NGC 7232A.  But since PGC 68317 is much brighter, the identification is probably more likely.

ESO 405-007 is 2.5 minutes of RA east and 2.5' north of Swift's position but his description is a much better fit.  Swift's positions were generally very poor in his last two lists, so the discrepancy is not unusual.  DeLisle Stewart is also credited in the IC, but he picked up IC 5179 on a Harvard plate.

Strongly concentrated with a large elongated bar oriented SSW-NNE (over 1' in length) within a brighter core. The bar dominates a much fainter diffuse outer halo of low surface brightness.  Still, there was a suggestion of spiral structure in the outer halo on the SSW and NNE ends.

A giant HII complex/OB association stood out on the SW side of the halo [1.5' SSW of center] as a small knot.  It appeared fairly faint, roundish, 12:-15" diameter, stellar or quasi-stellar nucleus.

Located 19' WSW of mag 6.4 Pi-1 and 23' WSW of mag 5.6 mag Pi-2 Gruis.  The pair is a nice binocular double at a wide 4' separation.  Pi-1 is a red giant transitioning into a carbon star and a very unequal double star (mag 6.5/10.7 at 2.8").

A brighter mag 10 comparison star lies 1.8' S but blinking with the filter the planetary switches apparent brightness with this star.  At 435x, IC 5217 appeared as a 7"x5" blue disc, slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  With direct vision, a slightly brighter quasi-stellar center was visible suggesting the central star was just below the threshold of visibility.

Without a filter, a brighter mag 10 star lies to the south though with the filter the planetary matches the star.  At 225x a definite small disc was visible, crisp-edged, round, ~6" diameter.  The seeing was too soft to use high power.

There is nothing at his position, but his RA for IC 5225 is 36 seconds to small (not unusual for his measurements at age 77).  It's reasonable to assume a similar offset for IC 5226, but there is nothing near this offset position.  But Harold Corwin found that if Swift made another error of exactly 1° in declination (too far north), his corrected position matches ESO 533-045.  Furthermore, the nearest star is about 4' away ("no * nr") and there are 4 stars to the southeast (including two 9th magnitude) matching his comment "trapezium".

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5264 = Sw. XI-219 on 15 Dec 1889.  He found this galaxy while measuring IC 1459 (discovered 2 nights earlier) with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  Barnard wrote in his logbook, "a small faint neb'y about 4' S and 1' p this neb [IC 1459].  Small and elong in parallel nearly."  No accurate offsets were measured, but this clearly applies to IC 5264.  As this entry was not published or passed along to Dreyer, Barnard didn't receive discovery credit in the IC.

Lewis Swift independently discovered IC 5264 on 10 Jun 1896 and described XI-219 as "vF; S; eeE; a ray; sp of below st; sp of 2 [with IC 1459 = IC 5265]."  His position is 0.2 min of RA too small and 3.5' too far south (same error in dec as IC 5265).  Dorothy Carlson incorrectly states "Not found, Helwan" in her 1940 list of NGC corrections.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5269 = Sw. XI-222 on 10 Sep 1896 and reported "vF; pS; R; np of 2 [with IC 5270]."  His position is 10 seconds of RA west and 6' north of ESO 406-032 = PGC 70110, not unusual for his later IC positions.  Swift confused the orientation as IC 5269 is the south-preceding of the pair, though the discovery dates are a month apart so the positions were recorded on different nights.

13.1" (7/20/85): faint, edge-on ~E-W, even surface brightness.  Otherwise similar in size and brightness to IC 5269 11' SSW.  The IC orientation for the pair is incorrect.  This galaxy is the furthest north in a string of ~10 galaxies stretching south to IC 5273.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5270 = Sw XI-223 on 12 Aug 1896 and recorded "vF; pS; vE; sf of 2 [with IC 5269]."  His position is 14' too far south and IC 5270 is the north-following of 2.  According to Swift's large AN table, he discovered nearby IC 5269 a month later, though the pair would have both been in his 33' field.  He probably added the comment "sf of 2" when preparing the table for publication.  MCG reverses the identifications of IC 5269 and IC 5270, probably because Swift's position for IC 5269 is 10' north of IC 5270 .

E.E. Barnard probably made an earlier observation of IC 5270 and IC 5269 on 15 Dec 1889 with the 12-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.  He recorded in his logbook, "pL, vF, extended, a small, faint __ (can't decipher word) 5' +/- S.  A 6m star 22' N and 1' following."  There is nothing at his position (in ink), but his declination is just 3' off from IC 5270 and the galaxy 5' +/- south is probably IC 5269.  The 6th mag star HD 217096 is 22' NNE of IC 5270, though 8' following.  Barnard never published these discoveries or informed Dreyer, so Swift is credited in the IC.

NGC 7520 is listed as nonexistent in most sources.  Harold Corwin suggests the possibility that NGC 7520 is equivalent to IC 5290 (described above). 

Johann Palisa discovered IC 5290 on 4 Oct 1896 with the 27-inch refractor at Wien University Observatory.  He noted it was found in the place of Comet Spitaler, which he was apparently searching for.

Harold Corwin suggests that NGC 7520, discovered by Wilhelm Tempel in 1876 may be identical to IC 5290.  There is nothing near his rough position (given only to the nearest min of time and noted as very uncertain "::").  This would require that Tempel's declination to be 20' too far south, though the RA is less than a minute off.  Still this identification is very uncertain and PGC uses IC 5290 as the designation (HyperLeda gives IC 5290 as the primary and NGC 7520 as a secondary designation).

These errors were first caught by Herbert Howe in his Dec 1899 paper on NGC/IC observations made at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.  Howe called the nearby star to the NW as 10th mag, although it is closer to 13th mag.

IC 5328A, a nearly superimposed companion, is attached at the southwest end of the halo.  It appeared faint to fairly faint, small, slightly elongated NW-SE, 20"x15", nearly even surface brightness.  The galaxy is elongated in the direction of mag 6.9 HD 221473 located 9' SW.  IC 5328B, located 14' SE, appeared fairly faint, edge-on 5:1 N-S, 0.5'x0.1', no noticeable core or nucleus, low surface brightness.  The galaxy is collinear with a mag 10.8 star situated 1.9' S.

James Dunlop possibly made the first observation.  He described D 546 (discovered on 14 Jul 1826) as an "extremely feeble nebula, ill defined; it appears rather elongated oblique to the equator; it is north following a star of the 7th magnitude, and also north of the small stars."  If this identification is correct (suggested by Glen Cozens), then Dunlop made a typo of 1 degree too far south in his position and 1 min of RA too large.  I'm skeptical, though, as this face-on spiral displays no elongation.

18" (8/25/06): this double galaxy is the brightest in AGC 4038 and appeared as a fairly faint glow, fairly small, elongated ~5:3 WNW-ESE, small bright core.  With careful viewing a very faint, very small companion was attached on the southwest side.

17.5" (11/1/97): initially seen as a single irregular-shaped galaxy but after careful viewing this double system was resolved into two nearly tangent objects oriented WSW-ENE (the brighter, larger object to the NE is IC 5358).  At moments both objects can be seen to have nearly stellar nuclei.  This cD galaxy is the brightest in AGC 4038 = Klemola 44.

17.5" (10/25/97): this faint galaxy is the largest of ten viewed in AGC 4038.  Appeared faint, fairly small, elongated 4:3 NW-SE, 1.2'x0.9', weak concentration.  Nearby is IC 5353 3.9' NW, IC 5354 3.5' W and PGC 72436 2.0' S.  Located 16' W of Delta Sculptoris (V = 4.5).

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5358 = Sw. XI-239 on 14 Sep 1896. His description reads "eF; S; R; 4th of 5 [with IC 5351, 5353, 5354 and 5362]."  His position is 3.6' too far southwest  (similar offset as IC 5353 and 5354).  Howe remeasured all these galaxies and mentions for IC 5358 "binuclear, at an angle of 250°, with a distance of 20"."  So Howe discovered IC 5358A, the attached companion on the southwest side, and it should have received an IC designation.

18" (9/3/05): extremely faint, small, very low surface brightness glow 1.5' following a mag 10 star.  In fairly poor seeing, the image was too unsteady to see the elongation well.

17.5" (9/3/94): faintest of four galaxies in the HCG 97 compact group.  Extremely faint, small, very elongated 4:1 NW-SE.  Only visible with averted vision and cannot be held steadily.  A mag 10, just 1.6' WSW, detracts from viewing.  Last in a group with IC 5351 4.7' W, IC 5357 3.8' WNW and IC 5356 4' SW.

E.E. Barnard discovered IC 5359 on 28 Oct 1889 while observing Comet Brooks (1889V) with the Lick 36-inch refractor.  He noted "F, pS, gbM."

Although centered in AGC 4049, IC 5362 appears to be foreground object at a similar redshift as AGC 4038, which is located about 0.9° WNW.

Lewis Swift discovered IC 5362 = Sw XI-241 on 14 Sep 1896 and recorded (in AN 3517) "eeF; pS; bet 2 B st; 5th of 5 [with IC 5350, 5353, 5354, and 5358]."  His description in AJ 388 reads, "eeF, pS, nrly bet an 8m * nf and a 9m * sp nearer the former 5th of 5."  There is nothing near his position (same in both lists).  Herbert Howe reported "I saw nothing in the place given by Swift, but measured one 34 seconds following at nearly the same declination.  It precedes a star of mag 8, 17 seconds, 2.3' south.  This star has a companion of mag 12 at 70°, 6"."  Howe's accurate position was used in the IC.  Swift probably discovered this galaxy again on 24 Jul 1897 and reported XII-45 (later IC 5363) as "vF, eS, R, 3 st in line p[receding], one D[ouble]."  His position was 18' southeast of IC 5362 (not unusual in his last summer of observing), but the description fits if the 3 stars in line are following, instead of preceding.

Herbert Howe found IC 5384 in 1899-00 while searching for NGC 7813 with the 20" refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver.  He reported "I do not find anything in the NGC place of this Muller nebula.  But 55 seconds following, at nearly the same declination, I found a similar object, elongated, however at 160°, while Muller puts the elongation at 80°.  He says "*8.5 f 38 seconds," while I found such a star preceding 49 seconds.  He also says "*9 np 40 seconds."  There are two such stars about 8' north, and a few seconds preceding.  The region may well be examined with a larger telescope."

Dreyer noted the possible equivalence with NGC 7813 in the IC description and Harold Corwin concludes "NGC 7813 is probably identical with IC 5384, though the descriptions do not match, and Muller's position is a typically poor one from the second Leander McCormick list in AJ."  MCG labels this galaxy IC 5384 as this designation is secure.
