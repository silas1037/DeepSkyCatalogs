Abstract:
    This catalogue of known  Galactic  supernova  remnants  (SNRs)  is  an
    updated version of the catalogues of Galactic SNRs presented in detail
    in  Green (1984, 1988), in summary form  in Green (1991, 1996), and on
    the World-Wide-Web (versions of July 1995 and August 1996). (Note that
    version published in Green (1996) was produced in 1993.)

    This  September 1998 version of the catalogue contains 220 SNRs, which
    is  5 more than listed in the previous version. The basic summary data
    included  in this catalogue for each SNR are its Galactic coordinates,
    RA  and Dec (B1950.0), angular size (in arcmin), type, flux density at
    1 GHz, spectral index, and any other names. Notes on these parameters,
    on possible remnants not included, and questionable SNRs listed in the
    catalogue   are  given  in  full  version  of  the  catalogue  on  the
    World-Wide-Web.  It should be  noted that there  are serious selection
    effects  which apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs (see Green
    1991), so  that great care should  be taken if these  data are used in
    statistical studies.

Note on SNR:
  This designation is based on the galactic longitude and latitude of 
  the source centroid quoted to the nearest tenth of a degree. (Note:
  in this catalogue additional leading zeros are not used.)

Note on RAh, RAm, RAs, DE-, DEd, DEm:
  The accuracy of the quoted values depends on the size of the
  remnant. For small remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of
  time and the nearest minute of arc for RA and DEC respectively. For
  the larger remnants they are rounded to coarser values. They are in
  every case sufficient to specify a point within the boundary of the
  remnant. These coordinates are generally deduced from radio maps
  rather than from X-ray or optical observations, and are B1950.0.

Note on MajDiam, MinDiam::
  Usually taken from the highest resolution radio map available,
  although for some barely resolved sources that are thought to be SNRs
  the only available size is that from Gaussian models after
  deconvolution with the observed beam size. The boundary of
  most remnants approximates reasonably well to a circle or an ellipse; a
  single value is quoted for the angular size of the more nearly circular
  remnants, which is the diameter of a circle with an area equal to that of
  the remnant, but for elongated remnants the product of two values is
  quoted, and these are the major and minor axes of the remnant boundary
  modeled as an ellipse. In a few cases an ellipse is not a satisfactory
  description of the boundary of the object (refer to the description of the
  individual object given the full catalogue entry), although an angular size
  is still quoted for information. For `filled-centre' remnants the size
  quoted is for the largest extent of the observed radio emission, not, as
  at times has been used, the half-width of the centrally brightened peak.

Note on S(1GHz):
  The flux density of the remnant at 1 GHz in Jansky. This is not a
  measured value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency
  spectrum of the source. The frequency of 1 GHz is chosen because flux
  density measurements at frequencies both above and below this value
  are usually available.

Note on Sp-Index, u_Sp-Index:
  The spectral index is {alpha} where   S({nu}) {prop.to} {v}^-{alpha}^
  The spectral index of the integrated radio emission from the remnant
  is either a value quoted from the literature, or one deduced from the
  available integrated flux densities of the remnant. For several SNRs a
  simple spectral model is not adequate to describe their radio emission
  because the spectral index varies across the face of the remnant or
  that the integrated spectrum is curved, and in these cases the spectral
  index includes the 'v' in u_SI. In some cases, for example where the
  remnant is highly confused with thermal emission, the spectral index
  is given as '?' since no value can be deduced with any confidence.

Note on type:
  S  remnant shows a shell radio structure
  F  remnant shows a filled center ('filled centre') radio structure
  C  remnant shows a composite or combination radio structure
  S?, C?, F? if there is some uncertainty
  ?  object is conventionally considered a SNR although its nature is
     poorly known or not well understood.

Note on Names:
  Other names commonly used for the object. These are given
  in parentheses if the remnant is only part of the source.
  For some objects, notably the Crab Nebula, not all common names
  are given.

Remarks:
  The on-line version on the World-Wide-Web contains much more
  information on the individual objects, include many references.
