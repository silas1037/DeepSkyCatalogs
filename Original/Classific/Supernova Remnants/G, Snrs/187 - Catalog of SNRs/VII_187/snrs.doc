                            1. The Catalogue Format

This catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is an updated version of
those presented in detail in Green (1984, 1988) and in summary form in Green
(1991, 1993) (hereafter Papers I, II, III and IV respectively). A detailed
version of the 1993 version of the catalogue was the first version to be made
available on the World-Wide-Web. This catalogue is available in summary form by
ftp, and in detail both in a paper version and on the World-Wide-Web at
"http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/www/research/ra/SNRs/snrs.intro.html".

This version of the catalogue contains 194 SNRs (which is 12 more than in Paper
IV), with about thousand references in the detailed listings. For each remnant
in the catalogue the following parameters are given.

   * Galactic Coordinates of the source centroid quoted to the nearest tenth of
     a degree as is conventional.
   * Other Names that are commonly used for the object. These are given in
     parentheses if the remnant is only a part of the source. For some object,
     notably the Crab Nebula, not all common names are given.
   * Right Ascension and Declination of the source centroid. The accuracy of
     the quoted values depends on the size of the remnant; for small remnants
     they are to the nearest few seconds of time and the nearest minute of arc
     respectively, whereas for larger remnants they are rounded to coarser
     values, but are in every case sufficient to specify a point within the
     boundary of the remnant. These coordinates are deduced from radio maps
     rather than from X-ray or optical observations, and are for B1950.0.
   * Angular Size of the remnant, in arcminutes, usually taken from the highest
     resolution radio map available, although for some barely resolved sources
     that are thought to be SNRs the only available size is that from Gaussian
     models after deconvolution with the observed beam size. The boundary of
     most remnants approximates reasonably well to a circle or an ellipse; a
     single value is quoted for the angular size of the more nearly circular
     remnants, which is the diameter of a circle with an area equal to that of
     the remnant, but for elongated remnants the product of two values is
     quoted, and these are the major and minor axes of the remnant boundary
     modelled as an ellipse. In a few cases an ellipse is not a satisfactory
     description of the boundary of the object (refer to the description of the
     individual object given in its catalogue entry), although an angular size
     is still quoted for information. For `filled-centre' remnants the size
     quoted is for the largest extent of the observed radio emission, not, as
     at times has been used, the half-width of the centrally brightened peak.
   * Flux Density of the remnant at 1 GHz in jansky. This is not a measured
     value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency spectrum of the
     source. The frequency of 1 GHz is chosen because flux density measurements
     at frequencies both above and below this value are usually available.
   * Spectral Index of the integrated radio emission from the remnant, either a
     value that is quoted in the literature, or one deduced from the available
     integrated flux densities of the remnant. For several SNRs a simple
     spectral model is not adequate to describe their radio emission because
     there is evidence that the spectral index varies across the face of the
     remnant or that the integrated spectrum is curved, and in these cases the
     spectral index is given as `varies' (refer to the description of the
     remnant and recent references in the catalogue entry for more
     information). In a few cases, where the remnant is highly confused with
     thermal emission, the spectral index is given as `?' since no value can be
     deduced with any confidence.
   * Type of the SNR, either `S', `F' or `C' if the remnant shows a `shell',
     `filled-centre' or `composite' (or `combination') radio structure (or
     `S?', `F?' or `C?', respectively, if there is some uncertainty), or `?' in
     several cases where an object is conventionally regarded as an SNR even
     though its nature is poorly known or not well understood.

In the detailed listings, for each remnant, notes on a variety of topics are
given. First, it is noted if other Galactic coordinates have at times been used
to label it (usually before good observations have revealed the full extent of
the object), if the SNR is thought to be the remnant of a historical SN, or if
the nature of the source as an SNR has been questioned (in which case an
appropriate reference is usually given later in the entry). Brief descriptions
of the remnant from the available radio, optical and X-ray observations as
applicable are then given, together with notes on available distance
determinations, and any point sources or pulsars in the field of the object
(although they may not necessarily be related to the remnant). Finally,
appropriate references are given for each remnant, complete with journal,
volume, page, and a short description of what information each paper contains
(for radio observations these include the telescopes used, the observing
frequencies and resolutions, together with any flux density determinations).
These references are not complete, but cover representative and recent
observations of the remnant, and they should themselves include references to
earlier work. The references do not generally include large observational
surveys - of particular interest in this respect are: the Effelsberg 100-m
survey at 2.7 GHz of the Galactic plane 358d < l < 240d, |b| < 5d by Reich et
al. (1990) and Furst et al. (1990); reviews of the radio spectra of SNRs by
Kassim (1989) and by Kovalenko, Pynzar' & Udal'tsov (1994); the recent survey
of the southern Galactic plane by Whiteoak & Green (1995), which is `in press';
the review of Einstein X-ray imaging and FPCS observations of Galactic SNRs by
Seward (1990) and Lum et al. (1992) respectively; surveys of IRAS observations
of SNRs and their immediate surroundings by Arendt (1989) and by Saken, Fesen &
Shull (1992); and the survey of HI emission towards SNRs by Koo & Heiles
(1991).

The catalogue is available as a summary listing of the parameters for each
remnant, and --- in the paper version or on the World-Wide-Web, --- as detailed
listings (with references) for each object, together with lists of other names
used for these SNRs and the abbreviations for journals, proceedings and
telescopes (both radio and X-ray) used in the detailed listings.


                            2. Revisions and Notes

                   2.1 Objects no longer thought to be SNRs

The following objects, which were listed in the catalogue in Paper I, have been
removed from the catalogue because they are no longer thought to be remnants,
or are poorly observed (see Paper II for references and further details):
G2.4+1.4 (see also Gray 1994a; Goss & Lozinskaya 1995), G41.9-4.1 (=CTB 73, PKS
1920+06), G47.6+6.1 (=CTB 63), G53.9+0.3 (part of HC40), G93.4+1.8 (=NRAO 655),
G123.2+2.9, G194.7+0.4 (the Origem Loop), G287.8-0.5 (see below), G322.3-1.2
(=Kes 24) and G343.0-6.0 (see below).

G350.1-0.3, which was listed in the catalogue in Paper II, was removed as it is
no longer thought to be a SNR (see Paper III for details).

G358.4-1.9, which was list in the catalogues in Paper IV has been removed, as
following the discussion of Gray (1994a), as it is not clear that this is a
SNR. The following objects, which have been reported as SNRs, but have not been
included in any of SNR catalogues, have subsequently been shown not to be SNRs.

   * G70.7+1.2 which was reported as a SNR by Reich et al. (1985), but this has
     not been confirmed by later observations (see Green 1986; de Muizon et al.
     1988; Becker & Fesen 1988; Caswell 1988; Bally et al. 1989; Phillips,
     Onello & Kulkarni 1993).
   * G81.6+1.0 a possible SNR in W75 reported by Ward-Thompson & Robson (1991).
     From the published data (see the observations in Wendker, Higgs &
     Landecker 1991) it was noted in Paper IV that this is thermal source not a
     SNR, because of its thermal radio spectrum, and high infrared-to-radio
     emission (see the subsequent discussion by Wendker et al. 1993).
   * Green & Gull (1984) suggested that G227.1+1.0 as a very young SNR, but
     subsequent observations (Channan et al. 1986; Green & Gull 1986) have
     shown that this is most likely an extragalactic source, not an SNR.
   * A candidate SNR, G274.7-2.8, identified by Helfand & Channan (1989), has
     been shown not to be a SNR by Caswell & Stewart (1991).
   * G25.5+0.2, which was reported as a very young SNR by Cowan et al. (1989),
     although this identification was not certain (see White & Becker 1990;
     Green 1990; Zijlstra 1991). Sramek et al. (1992) report the detection of
     recombination lines from this source (also see Subrahmanyan et al. 1993).
     Becklin et al. (1994) identify G25.5+0.2 as a ring nebula around a
     luminous blue star.
   * Most of the possible SNRs listed by Gorham (1990) - following up SNR
     candidates suggested by Kassim (1988) - have been shown not to be SNRs by
     Gorham et al. (1993).

Some entries in the catalogue have been renamed, due to improved observations
revealing a larger true extent for the object (G5.3-1.0 is now G5.4-1.2;
G193.3-1.5 is now G192.8-1.1; G308.7+0.0 is now G308.8-0.1).


                                 2.2 New SNRs

The following new remnants were added to the catalogue of Paper II: G0.9+0.1,
G1.9+0.3, G5.9+3.1, G6.4+4.0, G8.7-0.1, G16.8-1.1, G18.9-1.1, G20.0-0.2,
G27.8+0.6, G30.7+1.0, G31.5-0.6, G36.6-0.7, G42.8+0.6, G45.7-0.4, G54.1+0.3,
G73.9+0.9, G179.0+2.6, G312.4-0.4, G357.7+0.3 and G359.1-0.9.

The following new remnants were added to the catalogue of Paper III: G4.2-3.5,
G5.2-2.6, G6.1+1.2, G8.7-5.0, G13.5+0.2, G15.1-1.6, G16.7+0.1, G17.4-2.3,
G17.8-2.6, G30.7-2.0, G36.6+2.6, G43.9+1.6, G59.8+1.2, G65.1+0.6, G68.6-1.2,
G69.7+1.0, G279.0+1.1, G284.3-1.8 (=MSH 10-53), G358.4-1.9 and G359.0-0.9.

The following new remnants SNRs were added to the catalogue of Paper IV:
G59.5+0.1, G67.7+1.8, G84.9+0.5, G156.2+5.7, G318.9+0.4, G322.5-0.1,
G343.1-2.3, and G348.5-0.0.

Since Paper IV, the following SNRs have been added to the catalogue.

   * G1.0-0.1, which has previously been suggested as a SNR by various authors,
     following improved radio observations by Gray (1994a).
   * G28.8+1.5, identified from ROSAT X-ray observations by Schwentker (1994).
   * G76.9+1.0, observed by Landecker, Higgs & Wendker (1993).
   * G272.2-3.2, identified from ROSAT X-ray observations by Greiner, Egger &
     Aschenbach (1994).
   * Seven (G355.6-0.0, G356.3-0.3, G356.3-1.5, G359.1+0.9, G0.4-0.1, G3.7-0.2
     and G3.8+0.3) of the seventeen possible SNRs given by Gray (1994b).
   * G341.2+0.9 and G354.1+0.1, two SNRs associated with young pulsars observed
     by Frail, Goss & Whiteoak (1994).


          2.3 Possible and probable SNRs not listed in the catalogue

The following are possible or probable SNRs for which further observations are
required to confirm their nature or parameters, or for which observations are
not yet in the published literature.

   * G284.2-1.8 (=MSH 10-53), which was listed in early SNR catalogues, but
     subsequently rejected because of its apparent thermal spectrum (see
     Paper II for details). Ruiz & May (1986) report optical and CO radio
     observations that indicate the presence of shock-excited material in this
     region, supporting the SNR identification, although the parameters of any
     SNR are not well defined.
   * G343.0-6.0 was listed in Paper I as a SNR, identified optically by Meaburn
     & Rovithis (1977). However, it was removed from the catalogue in Paper II
     as its extent is uncertain, and it has not been identified at other
     wavelength (also see Bedford et al. 1984; Meaburn et al. 1991).
   * G287.6-0.8, which is associated with eta Carinae, was listed in Paper I as
     a SNR, but was removed from the catalogue in Paper II as its parameters
     are uncertain (see Jones 1973, Retallack 1984, Tateyama, Strauss &
     Kaufmann 1991, and the discussion in Paper II).
   * Several large, possible SNRs have been reported from X-ray observations
     (H1538-32 in Lupus, near l=307d, b=20d: Reigler, Agrawal & Gull 1980, see
     also Colomb, Dubner & Giacani 1984; in the Gum Nebula near l=250d, b=0d:
     Leahy, Nousek & Garmire 1992, see also Reynolds 1976 and Dubner et al.
     1992; in Eridanus near l=200d, b=-40d: Burrows et al. 1993, see also
     Snowden et al. 1995).
   * A possible SNR near the Galactic centre reported by Ho et al. (1985) from
     radio observations.
   * Gosachinskii (1985) reports evidence for non-thermal radio emission,
     presumably from SNRs, associated with several bright, thermal Galactic
     sources (also see Odegard 1986, who questions the reliability of some of
     Gosachinskii's results).
   * G300.1+9.4, a possible SNR nearly 2d in diameter reported by Dubner,
     Colomb & Giacani (1986) from radio observations.
   * G315.8-0.0, a possible `shell' SNR seen at radio wavelengths with a
     remarkable collimated `jet' of radio emission, reported by Kesteven et al.
     (1987), although this source has an unusually steep radio spectrum.
   * Routledge & Vaneldik (1988) report a possible faint shell SNR nearly 2d in
     diameter at radio wavelengths, near the young pulsar PSR 1930+22 (see also
     Gomez-Gonzalez & del Romero 1983, who report a smaller (about 40 arcmin)
     possible SNR (G57.1+1.7) associated with this pulsar, and see Caswell,
     Landecker & Feldman 1985 and Kovalenko 1989).
   * A SNR (G260.4-3.3) about 4 arcmin in diameter within the Puppis A remnant.
     This was identified optically by Winkler et al. (1989), but has not been
     detected at radio wavelengths (Dubner et al. 1991).
   * G28.6-0.2, a possible SNR reported by Helfand et al. (1989) from radio
     observations.
   * A possible SNR (G32.1+0.1) reported from optical spectroscopy by Thompson,
     Djorgovski & de Carvalho (1991), following up radio and infrared
     observations of Jones, Garwood & Dickey (1988).
   * G203.2-12.3, a optical ring about 3 arcmin in diameter, which was
     identified as a SNR by Winkler & Reipurth (1992).
   * Seven possible remnants (G45.9-0.1, G55.2+0.5, G63.7+1.1, G71.6-0.5,
     G72.2-0.3, G83.0-0.2 and G85.2-1.2) of the eleven reported by Taylor,
     Wallace & Goss (1992) from a radio survey of part of the Galactic plane.
     (One of the other possible SNRs reported by Taylor et al., G76.9+0.9, has
     now been included in the catalogue, but is called G76.9+1.0, see above.)
   * G75.5+2.4, a possible large (about 2d) old SNR in Cygnus suggested by
     Nichols-Bohlin & Fesen (1993) from infra-red and optical observations (see
     also Dewdney & Lozinskaya 1994).
   * A faint, poorly defined possible remnant G41.1+1.2 reported by Gorham et
     al. (1993) from radio observations.
   * G9.7-0.1, a possible SNR report by Frail, Kassim & Weiler (1994) from
     radio observations.
   * G104.7+2.8, a possible SNR reported by Green & Joncas (1994) from radio
     observations. However, recent observations at 10.7 GHz (W. Reich, private
     communication) cast doubt on this identification, as they do not support a
     non-thermal radio spectrum for the source.
   * Ten (G355.4+0.7, G356.6+0.1, G357.1-0.2, G358.1+1.0, G358.5-0.9,
     G358.7+0.7, G359.2-1.1, G0.3+0.0, G3.1-0.6 and G4.2+0.0) of the seventeen
     possible SNRs listed by Gray (1994b) from radio observations near the
     Galactic centre (see also Dagkesamanskii, Kovalenko & Udal'tsov 1994, who
     also suggest a SNR in the Galactic centre region (G0.4+0.1, which
     presumably related to G0.3+0.0 suggested by Gray) from radio
     observations).
   * G310.6-0.2 and G310.8-0.4, two possible radio SNRs listed by Whiteoak,
     Cram & Large (1994).
   * G189.6+3.3, a faint, possible SNR overlapping G189.1+3.0 (=IC443)
     identified by Asaoka & Aschenbach (1994) from ROSAT X-ray observations.
   * G11.2-1.1, a possible SNR listed by Kovalenko, Pynzar' & Udal'tsov (1994),
     based on unpublished radio studies (Trushkin 1988, preprint).
   * A possible optical SNR (G247.8+4.9) noted by Weinberger (1995), which may
     be Balmer dominated.
   * G299.2-2.9, a centrally-filled SNR about 15 arcmin in diameter, reported
     by Busser, Egger & Aschenbach (1995) from ROSAT X-ray observations.
   * Whiteoak & Green (1995) - which is currently `in press' - present lists of
     eighteen new (G286.5-1.2, G289.7-0.3, G294.1-0.0, G299.6-0.5, G301.4-1.0,
     G308.1-0.7, G317.3-0.2, G318.2+0.1, G321.9-1.1, G327.4+1.0, G329.7+0.4,
     G342.1+0.9, G343.1-0.7, G345.7-0.2, G349.2-0.1, G351.7+0.8, G351.9-0.9 and
     G354.8-0.8) and sixteen possible (G308.4-1.4, G317.5+0.9, G319.9-0.7,
     G320.6-0.9, G322.7+0.1, G322.9-0.0, G323.2-1.0, G324.1+0.1, G325.0-0.3,
     G331.8-0.0, G337.2+0.1, G339.6-0.6, G345.1+0.2, G345.1-0.2, G348.8+1.1 and
     G350.1-0.3) SNRs from their radio survey of much of the southern Galactic
     plane.

Finally, it should be noted that some radio loops in the Galactic plane (see
Berkhuijsen 1973) may be parts of very large, old SNRs, but they have not been
included in the catalogue (see also Combi et al. 1995).


                 2.4 Questionable SNRs listed in the catalogue

As noted in Paper II and IV, the following sources are listed in the catalogue
as SNRs, although, as discussed in each case, the identifications are not
certain: G5.4-1.2, G39.7-2.0 (=W50), G65.7+1.2 (=DA 495), G69.0+2.7 (=CTB 80),
G318.9+0.4 and G357.7-0.1. The nature of G76.9+1.0 (an unusual radio source
similar to G65.7+1.2 (=DA 495)), and of G354.1+0.1 (which appears to be similar
to G357.7-0.1 (=MHS 17-39)) which have been added to this version of catalogue,
are also uncertain (see Landecker, Higgs & Wendker 1993 and Frail, Goss &
Whiteoak 1994 respectively).

There are also some objects that have been identified as SNRs and are listed in
the catalogue, although they have been barely resolved in the available
observations, or are faint, and have not been well separated from confusing
background or nearby thermal emission, and their identification as SNRs, or at
least their parameters remain uncertain (see Paper II).


                               Acknowledgements

I am grateful to the many colleagues who have commented on the errors and
omissions in previous versions of the catalogue. No doubt errors remain in this
version, and I am always happy to receive from feedback from users of the
catalogue. In producing this revision of the catalogue I am particularly
grateful to Carys Pugh for her help with the literature searches required to
bring the detailed listings more up to date.
