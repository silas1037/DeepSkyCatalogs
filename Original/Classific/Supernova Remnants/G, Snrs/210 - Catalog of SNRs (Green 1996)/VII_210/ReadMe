Abstract:
    This catalog of known Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is an updated
    version (Version VI,  August 1996)  of the  catalogs of  Galactic SNRs
    presented in detail in  Green (Version  I 1984,  Version II  1988), in
    summary  form in Green (Version III 1991, Version IV 1996), and on the
    Web  (Version V, July 1995). (Note that Version IV, although published
    in 1996, was producted in 1993.)

    This August 1996 version of the catalog contains 215 SNRs, which is 21
    more than listed in the  previous  version.  The  basic  summary  data
    included in this catalog for each SNR are its Galactic coordinates, RA
    and Dec  (B1950.0), angular size (in arcmin),  type, flux density at 1
    GHz,  spectral index, and any other  names. Notes on these parameters,
    on possible remnants not included, and questionable SNRs listed in the
    catalog  are given in the documentation  file (snrs.doc). It should be
    noted  that there  are serious  selection effects  which apply  to the
    identification  of Galactic SNRs (see Green  1991), so that great care
    should be taken if these data are used in statistical studies.

Note on GLON, GLAT:
  Galactic Coordinates are the source centroid quoted to the nearest
  tenth of a degree.

Note on RAh, RAm, RAs, DE-, DEd, DEm:
  The accuracy of the quoted values depends on the size of the
  remnant. For small remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of
  time and the nearest minute of arc for RA and DEC respectively. For
  the larger remnants they are rounded to coarser values. They are in
  every case sufficient to specify a point within the boundary of the
  remnant. These coordinates are deduced from radio maps rather than
  from X-ray or optical observations, and are B1950.0.

Note on Ang_Size:
  Usually taken from the highest resolution radio map available,
  although for some barely resolved sources that are thought to be SNRs
  the only available size is that from Gaussian models after
  deconvolution with the observed beam size.  The boundary of
  most remnants approximates reasonably well to a circle or an ellipse; a
  single value is quoted for the angular size of the more nearly circular
  remnants, which is the diameter of a circle with an area equal to that of
  the remnant, but for elongated remnants the product of two values is
  quoted, and these are the major and minor axes of the remnant boundary
  modeled as an ellipse. In a few cases an ellipse is not a satisfactory
  description of the boundary of the object (refer to the description of the
  individual object given in its catalogue entry), although an angular size
  is still quoted for information. For `filled-centre' remnants the size
  quoted is for the largest extent of the observed radio emission, not, as
  at times has been used, the half-width of the centrally brightened peak.

Note on S(1GHz):
  The flux density of the remnant at 1 GHz in Jansky. This is not a
  measured value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency
  spectrum of the source. The frequency of 1 GHz is chosen because flux
  density measurements at frequencies both above and below this value
  are usually available.

Note on SI, u_SI:
  The spectral index of the integrated radio emission from the remnant
  is either a value quoted from the literature, or one deduced from the
  available integrated flux densities of the remnant. For several SNRs a
  simple spectral model is not adequate to describe their radio emission
  because the spectral index varies across the face of the remnant or
  that the integrated spectrum is curved, and in these cases the spectral
  index includes the 'v' in u_SI. In some cases where the remnant is highly
  confused with thermal emission, the spectral index is given as '?' since
  no value can be deduced with any confidence.

Note on type:
  S  remnant shows a shell
  F  remnant shows a filled center ('filled centre')
  C  remnant shows a composite or combination radio structure
  S?, C?, F? if there is some uncertainty
  ?  object is conventionally considered a SNR although its nature is
     poorly known or not well understood.

Note on alt:
  Other names commonly used for the object. These are given
  in parentheses if the remnant is only part of the source.
  For some objects, notably the Crab Nebula, not all common names
  are given.

Remarks:
  The on-line version on the WWW is searchable and contains much more
  information on the individual objects.
