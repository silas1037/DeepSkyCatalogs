1. The Catalogue Format

This catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is an updated version
of those presented in detail in Green (1984, 1988), in summary form in
Green (1991, 1996) - hereafter Versions I, II, III and IV respectively -
and on the World-Wide-Web (Version V, 1995 July). (Note that Version IV,
although published in 1996, was produced in 1993.)

This, the 1996 August version of the catalogue contains 215 SNRs (which is
21 more than in Version V), with about thousand references in the detailed
listings, plus notes on several dozen possible or probable remnants. For
each remnant in the catalogue the following parameters are given.

   * Galactic Coordinates of the source centroid quoted to the nearest
     tenth of a degree as is conventional.
   * Other Names that are commonly used for the object. These are given in
     parentheses if the remnant is only a part of the source. For some
     object, notably the Crab Nebula, not all common names are given.
   * Right Ascension and Declination of the source centroid. The accuracy
     of the quoted values depends on the size of the remnant; for small
     remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of time and the nearest
     minute of arc respectively, whereas for larger remnants they are
     rounded to coarser values, but are in every case sufficient to specify
     a point within the boundary of the remnant. These coordinates are
     almost always deduced from radio maps rather than from X-ray or
     optical observations, and are for B1950.0.
   * Angular Size of the remnant, in arcminutes, usually taken from the
     highest resolution radio map available, although for some barely
     resolved sources that are thought to be SNRs the only available size
     is that from Gaussian models after deconvolution with the observed
     beam size. The boundary of most remnants approximates reasonably well
     to a circle or an ellipse; a single value is quoted for the angular
     size of the more nearly circular remnants, which is the diameter of a
     circle with an area equal to that of the remnant, but for elongated
     remnants the product of two values is quoted, and these are the major
     and minor axes of the remnant boundary modelled as an ellipse. In a
     few cases an ellipse is not a satisfactory description of the boundary
     of the object (refer to the description of the individual object given
     in its catalogue entry), although an angular size is still quoted for
     information. For `filled-centre' remnants the size quoted is for the
     largest extent of the observed radio emission, not, as at times has
     been used, the half-width of the centrally brightened peak.
   * Flux Density of the remnant at 1 GHz in jansky. This is not a measured
     value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency spectrum of
     the source. The frequency of 1 GHz is chosen because flux density
     measurements at frequencies both above and below this value are
     usually available.
   * Spectral Index of the integrated radio emission from the remnant,
     either a value that is quoted in the literature, or one deduced from
     the available integrated flux densities of the remnant. For several
     SNRs a simple spectral model is not adequate to describe their radio
     emission because there is evidence that the spectral index varies
     across the face of the remnant or that the integrated spectrum is
     curved, and in these cases the spectral index is given as `varies'
     (refer to the description of the remnant and recent references in the
     catalogue entry for more information). In some cases, for example
     where the remnant is highly confused with thermal emission, the
     spectral index is given as `?' since no value can be deduced with any
     confidence.
   * Type of the SNR, either `S', `F' or `C' if the remnant shows a
     `shell', `filled-centre' or `composite' (or `combination') radio
     structure (or `S?', `F?' or `C?', respectively, if there is some
     uncertainty), or `?' in several cases where an object is
     conventionally regarded as an SNR even though its nature is poorly
     known or not well understood.

In the detailed listings, for each remnant, notes on a variety of topics
are given. First, it is noted if other Galactic coordinates have at times
been used to label it (usually before good observations have revealed the
full extent of the object), if the SNR is thought to be the remnant of a
historical SN, or if the nature of the source as an SNR has been questioned
(in which case an appropriate reference is usually given later in the
entry). Brief descriptions of the remnant from the available radio, optical
and X-ray observations as applicable are then given, together with notes on
available distance determinations, and any point sources or pulsars in the
field of the object (although they may not necessarily be related to the
remnant). Finally, appropriate references to observations are given for
each remnant, complete with journal, volume, page, and a short description
of what information each paper contains (for radio observations these
include the telescopes used, the observing frequencies and resolutions,
together with any flux density determinations). These references are not
complete, but cover representative and recent observations of the remnant,
and they should themselves include references to earlier work. The
references do not generally include large observational surveys - of
particular interest in this respect are: the Effelsberg 100-m survey at
2.7 GHz of the Galactic plane 358d < l < 240d, |b| < 5d by Reich et al.
(1990) and Furst et al. (1990); reviews of the radio spectra of some SNRs
by Kassim (1989) and by Kovalenko, Pynzar' & Udal'tsov (1994); the Parkes
64-m survey at 2.4 GHz of the Galactic plane 238d < l < 365d, |b| < 5d by
Duncan et al. (1995); reviews of Einstein X-ray imaging and FPCS
observations of Galactic SNRs by Seward (1990) and Lum et al. (1992)
respectively; surveys of IRAS observations of SNRs and their immediate
surroundings by Arendt (1989) and by Saken, Fesen & Shull (1992); and the
survey of HI emission towards SNRs by Koo & Heiles (1991).

The catalogue is available as a summary listing of the parameters for each
remnant, and as detailed listings (with references) for each object. Also
see the list of other names used for these SNRs, and the list of
abbreviations for journals, proceedings and telescopes (both radio and
X-ray) used in the detailed listings.

2. Revisions and Notes

2.1 Objects no longer thought to be SNRs

The following objects, which were listed in Version I of the catalogue were
removed because they were no longer thought to be remnants, or are poorly
observed (see Version II for references and further details): G2.4+1.4 (see
also Gray 1994a; Goss & Lozinskaya 1995; Polcaro et al. 1995), G41.9-4.1
(=CTB 73, PKS 1920+06), G47.6+6.1 (=CTB 63), G53.9+0.3 (part of HC40),
G93.4+1.8 (=NRAO 655), G123.2+2.9, G194.7+0.4 (the Origem Loop), G287.8-0.5
(see below), G322.3-1.2 (=Kes 24) and G343.0-6.0 (see below).

G350.1-0.3, which was listed in Version II of the catalogue, was removed as
it is no longer thought to be a SNR (see Version III for details).

G358.4-1.9, which was listed in Version IV of the catalogue, was removed,
as following the discussion of Gray (1994a), as it is not clear that this
is a SNR.

In this version of the catalogue the following have been removed:

   * G240.9-0.9, as Duncan et al. (1996) show that it is not a distinct
     SNR;
   * G299.0+0.2 and G328.0+0.3, following improved radio observations, and
     comparisons with IRAS data by Whiteoak & Green (1996) which showed
     that these are not SNRs.

The following objects, which have been reported as SNRs, but have not been
included in any of SNR catalogues, have subsequently been shown not to be
SNRs.

   * G70.7+1.2, which was reported as a SNR by Reich et al. (1985), but
     this has not been confirmed by later observations (see Green 1986; de
     Muizon et al. 1988; Becker & Fesen 1988; Caswell 1988; Bally et al.
     1989; Phillips, Onello & Kulkarni 1993; Onello et al. 1995).
   * G81.6+1.0 a possible SNR in W75 reported by Ward-Thompson & Robson
     (1991). From the published data (see the observations in Wendker,
     Higgs & Landecker 1991) it was noted in Version IV of the catalogue
     that this is thermal source not a SNR, because of its thermal radio
     spectrum, and high infrared-to-radio emission (see the subsequent
     discussion by Wendker et al. 1993).
   * Green & Gull (1984) suggested that G227.1+1.0 as a very young SNR, but
     subsequent observations (Channan et al. 1986; Green & Gull 1986) have
     shown that this is most likely an extragalactic source, not an SNR.
   * A candidate SNR, G274.7-2.8, identified by Helfand & Channan (1989),
     has been shown not to be a SNR by Caswell & Stewart (1991).
   * G25.5+0.2, which was reported as a very young SNR by Cowan et al.
     (1989), although this identification was not certain (see White &
     Becker 1990; Green 1990; Zijlstra 1991). Sramek et al. (1992) report
     the detection of recombination lines from this source (also see
     Subrahmanyan et al. 1993). Becklin et al. (1994) identify G25.5+0.2 as
     a ring nebula around a luminous blue star.
   * Most of the possible SNRs listed by Gorham (1990) - following up SNR
     candidates suggested by Kassim (1988) - have been shown not to be SNRs
     by Gorham, Kulkarni & Prince (1993).

Some entries in the catalogue have been renamed, due to improved
observations revealing a larger true extent for the object (G5.3-1.0 is now
G5.4-1.2; G193.3-1.5 is now G192.8-1.1; G308.7+0.0 is now incorporated into
G308.8-0.1).

     and G354.8-0.8, identified or confirmed as SNRs from the MOST radio
     survey of Whiteoak & Green (1996).

2.3 Possible and probable SNRs not listed in the catalogue

The following are possible or probable SNRs for which further observations
are required to confirm their nature or parameters, or for which
observations are not yet in the published literature.

2.3.1 Radio

   * A possible SNR near the Galactic centre reported by Ho et al. (1985)
     from radio observations.
   * Gosachinskii (1985) reported evidence for non-thermal radio emission,
     presumably from SNRs, associated with several bright, thermal Galactic
     sources (also see Odegard 1986, who questions the reliability of some
     of Gosachinskii's results).
   * G300.1+9.4, a possible SNR nearly 2d in diameter reported by Dubner,
     Colomb & Giacani (1986) from radio observations.
   * Routledge & Vaneldik (1988) report a possible faint shell SNR nearly
     2d in diameter at radio wavelengths, near the young pulsar PSR 1930+22
     (see also Gomez-Gonzalez & del Romero 1983, who report a smaller
     (about 40 arcmin) possible SNR (G57.1+1.7) associated with this
     pulsar, and see Caswell, Landecker & Feldman 1985 and Kovalenko 1989).
   * G28.6-0.2, a possible SNR reported by Helfand et al. (1989) from radio
     observations.
   * Seven possible remnants (G45.9-0.1, G55.2+0.5, G63.7+1.1, G71.6-0.5,
     G72.2-0.3, G83.0-0.2 and G85.2-1.2) of the eleven reported by Taylor,
     Wallace & Goss (1992) from a radio survey of part of the Galactic
     plane. (One of the other possible SNRs reported by Taylor et al.,
     G76.9+0.9, has now been included in the catalogue, but is called
     G76.9+1.0, see above.)
   * A faint, poorly defined possible remnant G41.1+1.2 reported by Gorham
     et al. (1993) from radio observations.
   * G9.7-0.1, a possible SNR report by Frail, Kassim & Weiler (1994) from
     radio observations.
   * Ten (G355.4+0.7, G356.6+0.1, G357.1-0.2, G358.1+1.0, G358.5-0.9,
     G358.7+0.7, G359.2-1.1, G0.3+0.0, G3.1-0.6 and G4.2+0.0) of the
     seventeen possible SNRs listed by Gray (1994b) from radio observations
     near the Galactic centre (see also Dagkesamanskii, Kovalenko &
     Udal'tsov 1994, who from radio observations also suggest a SNR,
     G0.4+0.1, in the Galactic centre region which presumably related to
     G0.3+0.0 suggested by Gray).
   * G104.7+2.8, a possible SNR reported by Green & Joncas (1994) from
     radio observations. However, recent observations at 10.7 GHz
     (W. Reich, private communication) cast doubt on this identification,
     as they do not support a non-thermal radio spectrum for the source.
   * G310.6-0.2 and G310.8-0.4, two possible radio SNRs listed by Whiteoak,
     Cram & Large (1994).
   * G11.2-1.1, a possible SNR listed by Kovalenko, Pynzar' & Udal'tsov
     (1994), based on unpublished radio studies (Trushkin 1988, preprint).
   * Duncan et al. (1995) list 10 large-scale (1.5 to 10 degree), and 22
     smaller, low radio surface-brightness candidate SNRs.
   * Whiteoak & Green (1996) list sixteen possible SNRs (G308.4-1.4,
     G317.5+0.9, G319.9-0.7, G320.6-0.9, G322.7+0.1, G322.9-0.0,
     G323.2-1.0, G324.1+0.1, G325.0-0.3, G331.8-0.0, G337.2+0.1,
     G339.6-0.6, G345.1+0.2, G345.1-0.2, G348.8+1.1 and G350.1-0.3) from
     their radio survey of much of the southern Galactic plane.

2.3.1 Optical/Infra-red

   * G343.0-6.0 was listed in Version I as a SNR, identified optically by
     Meaburn & Rovithis (1977). However, it was removed from the catalogue
     in Version II as its extent is uncertain, and it has not been
     identified at other wavelengths (also see Bedford et al. 1984; Meaburn
     et al. 1991).
   * A possible SNR overlapping G296.1-0.5, identified from optical (and
     X-ray) observations by Hutchings, Crampton & Cowley (1981).
   * A SNR (G260.4-3.3) about 4 arcmin in diameter within the Puppis A
     remnant identified optically by Winkler et al. (1989). This has not
     been detected at radio wavelengths (Dubner et al. 1991).
   * A possible SNR (G32.1+0.1) reported from optical spectroscopy by
     Thompson, Djorgovski & de Carvalho (1991), following up radio and
     infrared observations of Jones, Garwood & Dickey (1988).
   * G203.2-12.3, a optical ring about 3 arcmin in diameter, which was
     identified as a SNR by Winkler & Reipurth (1992).
   * G75.5+2.4, a possible large (about 2d) old SNR in Cygnus suggested by
     Nichols-Bohlin & Fesen (1993) from infra-red and optical observations
     (see also Dewdney & Lozinskaya 1994).
   * A possible optical SNR (G247.8+4.9) noted by Weinberger (1995), which
     may be Balmer dominated.

2.3.3 X-ray

   * H1538-32 a large X-ray source in Lupus, near l=307d, b=20d (Reigler,
     Agrawal & Gull 1980, see also Colomb, Dubner & Giacani 1984) which is
     a possible old SNR;
   * The Monogem ring, near l=203d, b=+12d, is a possible old SNR (see
     Nousek et al. 1981; Plucinsky et al. 1996, and references therein).
   * X-ray emission in the Gum Nebula near l=250d, b=0d (Leahy, Nousek &
     Garmire 1992, see also Reynolds 1976, Dubner et al. 1992 and Duncan et
     al. 1996) which, together with optical spectra indicate a possible old
     remnant;
   * an X-ray enhancement due to an old SNR in Eridanus near l=200d, b=-40d
     (Naranan et al. 1976, see also Burrows et al. 1993 and Snowden et al.
     1995).
   * G189.6+3.3, a faint, possible SNR overlapping G189.1+3.0 (=IC443)
     identified by Asaoka & Aschenbach (1994) from ROSAT X-ray
     observations.
   * G117.7+0.6, a faint shell of soft X-ray emission near CTB1
     (=G116.9+0.2), which contains a pulsar (Hailey & Craig 1995).

2.3.4 Other

   * G284.2-1.8 (=MSH 10-53), which was listed in early SNR catalogues, but
     subsequently rejected because of its apparent thermal spectrum (see
     Version II for details). Ruiz & May (1986) report optical and CO radio
     observations that indicate the presence of shock-excited material in
     this region, supporting the SNR identification, although the
     parameters of any SNR are not well defined.
   * G287.8-0.5, which is associated with eta Carinae, was listed in
     Version I as a SNR, but was removed from the catalogue in Version II
     as its parameters are uncertain (see Jones 1973, Retallack 1984,
     Tateyama, Strauss & Kaufmann 1991, and the discussion in Version II).
   * G359.2-0.8 (the `mouse'), near the Galactic centre, which has been
     suggested as being analogous to the central region of CTB 80
     (=G69.0+2.7) by Predehl & Kulkarni (1995).

Finally, it should be noted that some radio loops in the Galactic plane
(see Berkhuijsen 1973) may be parts of very large, old SNRs, but they have
not been included in the catalogue (see also Combi et al. 1995).

2.4 Questionable SNRs listed in the catalogue

As noted in Versions II and IV of the catalogue, the following sources are
listed as SNRs, although, as discussed in each case, the identifications
are not certain: G5.4-1.2, G39.7-2.0 (=W50), G65.7+1.2 (=DA 495), G69.0+2.7
(=CTB 80), G318.9+0.4 and G357.7-0.1. The nature of G76.9+1.0 (an unusual
radio source similar to G65.7+1.2 (=DA 495)), and of G354.1+0.1 (which
appears may be similar to G357.7-0.1 (=MHS 17-39)) are also uncertain (see
Landecker, Higgs & Wendker 1993 and Frail, Goss & Whiteoak 1994
respectively).

There are also some objects that have been identified as SNRs and are
listed in the catalogue, although they have been barely resolved in the
available observations, or are faint, and have not been well separated from
confusing background or nearby thermal emission, and their identification
as SNRs, or at least their parameters remain uncertain.
