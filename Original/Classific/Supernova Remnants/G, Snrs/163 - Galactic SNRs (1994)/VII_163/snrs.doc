                            1. The Catalogue Format
                            -----------------------

This catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) is an updated version of
those presented in detail in Green (1984, 1988) and in summary form in Green
(1991) (hereafter Papers I, II, and III respectively). This version contains
182 SNRs (which is 8 more than in the summary catalogue of Paper III and 26
more than in the detailed catalogue of Paper II).

A summary of this catalogue will be included in the proceedings of the IAU
Colloquium 145 on `Supernovae and Supernova Remnants', held in Xian, China,
1993 May 22 to 29, to be published by Cambridge University Press, editors
McCray, R. & Wang, Z. This paper should be referenced for this version of the
catalogue.

For each remnant in the catalogue the following parameters are given:

        * `Galactic Coordinates' of the source centroid quoted to
          the nearest tenth of a degree as is conventional.

        * `Other Names' that are commonly used for the object. These
          are given in parentheses if the remnant is only a part of
          the source.

        * `Right Ascension' and `Declination' of the source
          centroid. The accuracy of the quoted values depends on the
          size of the remnant; for small remnants they are to the
          nearest few seconds of time and the nearest minute of arc
          respectively, whereas for larger remnants they are rounded
          to coarser values, but are in every case sufficient to
          specify a point within the boundary of the remnant. These
          coordinates are deduced from radio maps rather than from
          X-ray or optical observations, and are for B1950.0.

        * `Angular Size' of the remnant, in arcminutes, usually
          taken from the highest resolution radio map available,
          although for some barely resolved sources that are thought
          to be SNRs the only available size is that from Gaussian
          models after deconvolution with the observed beam size. The
          boundary of most remnants approximates reasonably well to a
          circle or an ellipse; a single value is quoted for the
          angular size of the more nearly circular remnants, which is
          the diameter of a circle with an area equal to that of the
          remnant, but for elongated remnants the product of two
          values is quoted, and these are the major and minor axes of
          the remnant boundary modelled as an ellipse. In a few cases
          an ellipse is not a satisfactory description of the boundary
          of the object (refer to the description of the individual
          object given in its catalogue entry), although an angular
          size is still quoted for information. For `filled-centre'
          remnants the size quoted is for the largest extent of the
          observed radio emission, not, as at times has been used, the
          half-width of the centrally brightened peak.

        * `Flux Density' of the remnant at 1 GHz in jansky. This is
          not a measured value, but that deduced from the observed
          radio frequency spectrum of the source. The frequency of
          1 GHz is chosen because flux density measurements at
          frequencies both above and below this value are usually
          available.

        * `Spectral Index' of the integrated radio emission from the
          remnant, either a value that is quoted in the literature, or
          one deduced from the available integrated flux densities of
          the remnant. For several SNRs a simple spectral model is not
          adequate to describe their radio emission because there is
          evidence that the spectral index varies across the face of
          the remnant or that the integrated spectrum is curved, and
          in these cases the spectral index is given as `varies'
          (refer to the description of the remnant and recent
          references in the catalogue entry for more information). In
          a few cases, where the remnant is highly confused with
          thermal emission, the spectral index is given as `?' since
          no value can be deduced with any confidence.

        * `Type' of the SNR, either `S', `F' or `C' if the remnant
          shows a `shell', `filled-centre' or `composite' (or
          `combination') radio structure (or `S?', `F?' or `C?',
          respectively, if there is some uncertainty), or `?' in
          several cases where an object is conventionally regarded as
          an SNR even though its nature is poorly known or not well
          understood.

                            2. Revisions and Notes
                            ----------------------

                   2.1 Objects no longer thought to be SNRs

The following objects, which were listed in the catalogue in Paper I, have been
removed from the catalogue because they are no longer thought to be remnants,
or are poorly observed (see Paper II for references and further details):
G2.4+1.4, G41.9-4.1 (=CTB 73, PKS 1920+06), G47.6+6.1 (=CTB 63), G53.9+0.3
(part of HC40), G93.4+1.8 (=NRAO 655), G123.2+2.9, G194.7+0.4 (the Origem
Loop), G287.8-0.5, G322.3-1.2 (=Kes 24) and G343.0-6.0.

G350.1-0.3, which was listed in the catalogue in Paper II, was removed as it is
no longer thought to be a SNR (see Paper III for details). No objects listed in
the catalogue in Paper III have since been removed.

The following objects, which have been reported as SNRs, but have not been
included in any of SNR catalogues, have subsequently been shown not to be SNRs:

        * G70.7+1.2 which was reported as a SNR by Reich et al.
          (1985), but this has not been confirmed by subsequent
          observations (see Green 1986; de Muizon et al. 1988; Becker
          & Fesen 1988; Caswell 1988; Bally et al. 1989).

        * G81.6+1.0 a possible SNR in W75 reported by Ward-Thompson
          & Robson (1991) is instead a thermal source, because of its
          thermal radio spectrum, and high infrared-to-radio emission
          (see the observations in Wendker, Higgs & Landecker 1991).

        * Green & Gull (1984) suggested that G227.1+1.0 as a very
          young SNR, but subsequent observations (Channan et al. 1986;
          Green & Gull 1986) have shown that this is most likely an
          extragalactic source, not an SNR.

        * A candidate SNR, G274.7-2.8, identified by Helfand &
          Channan (1989), has been shown not to be a SNR by Caswell &
          Stewart (1991).

        * G25.5+0.2, which was reported as a very young SNR by Cowan
          et al. (1990), although this identification was not certain
          (see White & Becker 1990; Green 1990; Zijlstra 1991). Sramek
          et al. (1992) report the detection of recombination lines
          from this source.

        * Most of the possible SNRs listed by Gorham (1990) have
          been shown not to be SNRs by Gorham, Kulkarni & Prince
          (1993).

Some entries in the catalogue have been renamed, due to improved observations
revealing a larger true extent for the object (G5.3-1.0 is now G5.4-1.2;
G193.3-1.5 is now G192.8-1.1; G308.7+0.0 is now G308.8-0.1).


                                 2.2 New SNRs

The following new remnants were added to the catalogue of Paper II: G0.9+0.1,
G1.9+0.3, G5.9+3.1, G6.4+4.0, G8.7-0.1, G16.8-1.1, G18.9-1.1, G20.0-0.2,
G27.8+0.6, G30.7+1.0, G31.5-0.6, G36.6-0.7, G42.8+0.6, G45.7-0.4, G54.1+0.3,
G73.9+0.9, G179.0+2.6, G312.4-0.4, G357.7+0.3 and G359.1-0.9.

The following new remnants were added to the catalogue of Paper III: G4.2-3.5,
G5.2-2.6, G6.1+1.2, G8.7-5.0, G13.5+0.2, G15.1-1.6, G16.7+0.1, G17.4-2.3,
G17.8-2.6, G30.7-2.0, G36.6+2.6, G43.9+1.6, G59.8+1.2, G65.1+0.6, G68.6-1.2,
G69.7+1.0, G279.0+1.1, G284.3-1.8 (=MSH 10-5(3)), G358.4-1.9 and G359.0-0.9.

Since Paper III, the following SNRs have been added to the catalogue:

       * Three new remnants (G59.5+0.1, G67.7+1.8 and G84.9+0.5) of
         the the eleven possible SNRs reported by Taylor, Wallace &
         Goss (1992).

       * G156.2+5.7, which was first identified from X-ray
         observations by ROSAT (Pfeffermann, Aschenbach & Predehl
         1991).

       * G318.9+0.4, a complex of radio arcs reported by Whiteoak
         (1990).

       * G322.5-0.1, reported by Whiteoak (1992).

       * G343.1-2.3, an incomplete radio shell, with an associated
         pulsar (McAdam, Osborne & Parkinson 1993).

       * G348.5-0.0, a radio arc near G348.5+0.1 (=CTB 37A),
         revealed by Kassim, Baum & Weiler (1991).


                 2.3 Possible SNRs not listed in the catalogue

The following are possible SNRs for which further observations are required to
confirm their nature.

       * Eight possible remnants (G45.9-0.1, G55.2+0.5, G63.7+1.1,
         G71.6-0.5, G72.2-0.3, G76.9+0.9, G83.0-0.2 and G85.2-1.2) of
         the the eleven reported by Taylor, Wallace & Goss (1992).

       * G287.6-0.6 and G343.0-6.0 --- both of which were listed in
         Paper I as SNRs but have been removed from the catalogue
         because only limited observations are available --- should
         be considered as possible SNRs (see Tateyama, Strauss &
         Kaufmann 1991 for G287.6-0.6).

       * G284.2-1.8 (=MSH 10-5(3)), which was listed in early SNR
         catalogues, but subsequently rejected because of its
         apparent thermal spectrum (see Paper II for details). Ruiz &
         May (1986) report optical and CO radio observations that
         indicate the presence of shock-excited material, supporting
         the SNR identification, although the parameters of any SNR
         are not well defined.

       * A possible SNR within the Puppis A remnant (Winkler et al.
         1989).

       * G300.1+9.4, a possible SNR reported by Dubner, Colomb &
         Giacani (1986).

       * G203.2-12.3, a filamentary optical ring identified as a
         SNR by Winkler & Reipurth (1992).

       * G315.8-0.0, a possible `shell' SNR with a remarkable
         collimated `jet' of radio emission, reported by Kesteven et
         al. (1987), although this source has an unusually steep
         spectrum.

       * A possible SNR near l=32d reported by Thompson, Djorgovski
         & Decarvalho (1991).

       * A faint, poorly defined possible remnant G41.1+1.2
         reported by Gorham, Kulkarni & Prince et al. (1993).

       * A possible large SNR in Lupus near l=347d, b=22d (Reigler,
         Agrawal & Gull 1980; Colomb, Dubner & Giacani 1984).

       * G1.0-0.1, a possible SNR near the Galactic centre reported
         by Downes et al. (1978).

       * G75.5+2.4, a possible old SNR in Cygnus (Nichols-Bohlin &
         Fesen 1993).

Other possible SNRs are reported by Ho et al. (1985), Gosachinskii (1985),
Odegard (1986), Fuerst, Reich & Sofue (1987), Routledge & Vaneldik (1988),
Kassim (1988), Helfand et al. (1989), Meaburn et al. (1991), Leahy, Nousek &
Garmire (1992), and Dubner et al. (1992).

Finally, it should be noted that some radio loops in the Galactic plane (see
Berkhuijsen 1973) may be parts of very large, old SNRs, but they have not been
included in the catalogue.


                 2.4 Questionable SNRs listed in the catalogue

As noted in Paper II, the following sources are listed in the catalogue as
SNRs, although, as discussed in each case, the identifications are not certain:
G5.4-1.2, G39.7-2.0 (=W50), G65.7+1.2 (=DA 495), G69.0+2.7 (=CTB 80),
G357.7-0.1. The nature of G318.9+0.4 is also uncertain (see Whiteoak 1990).

There are also many objects that have been identified as SNRs and are listed in
the catalogue, although they have been barely resolved in the available
observations, or are faint, and have not been well separated from confusing
background or nearby thermal emission, and their identification as SNRs, or at
least their parameters remain uncertain (see Paper II).


                            3. A Detailed Catalogue
                            -----------------------

A detailed (paper) version of this catalogue is available from the author on
request. This includes, for each remnant, notes on a variety of topics. First,
it is noted if other Galactic coordinates have at times been used to label it
(usually before good observations have revealed the full extent of the object),
if the SNR is thought to be the remnant of a historical SN, or if the nature of
the source as an SNR has been questioned (in which case an appropriate
reference is usually given later in the entry). Brief descriptions of the
remnant from the available radio, optical and X-ray observations as applicable
are then given, together with notes on available distance determinations, and
any point sources or pulsars in the field of the object (although they may not
necessarily be related to the remnant). Finally, appropriate references are
given for each remnant, complete with journal, volume, page, and a short
description of what information each paper contains (for radio observations
these include the telescopes used, the observing frequencies and resolutions,
together with any flux density determinations). These references are not
complete, but cover representative and recent observations of the remnant, and
they should themselves include references to earlier work. This version of the
catalogue contains nearly two hundred more references in the detailed listings
than in Paper II. The references do not generally include large observational
surveys --- of particular interest in this respect are: the Effelsberg 100-m
survey at 2.7 GHz of the Galactic plane 358d < l < 240d, |b| < 5d by Reich et
al. (1990) and Fuerst et al. (1990); the review of Einstein X-ray imaging and
FPCS observations of Galactic SNRs by Seward (1990) and Lum et al. (1992)
respectively; the survey of IRAS observations of SNRs and their immediate
surroundings by Arendt (1989) and by Saken, Fesen & Shull (1992); and the
survey of HI emission towards SNRs by Koo & Heiles (1991).
