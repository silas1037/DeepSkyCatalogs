Abstract:
    This catalog lists all galactic supernova remnants known and is an
    updated version of the catalogues of Galactic SNRs presented in detail
    in Green (1984, MN, 209, 449; 1988, ApSS, 148, 3) and in summary form
    in Green (1991, PASP, 103, 209). The basic parameters of the 182 SNRs
    included in this (1993 May) version of the catalogue are, for each
    SNR, its Galactic coordinates, RA and Dec (B1950.0), angular size (in
    arcmin), type, flux density at 1 GHz, spectral index, and any other
    names. Notes on these parameters, on possible remnants not included
    and questionable SNRs listed in the catalogue are given in the
    documentation. It should be noted that there are serious selection
    effects which apply to the identification of Galactic SNRs (see Green
    1991), so that great care should be taken if these data are used in
    statistical studies.

Note on GLON, GLAT:
  Galactic Coordinates are the source centroid quoted to the nearest
  tenth of a degree.
Note on RAh, RAm, RAs, DE-, DEd, DEm:
  The accuracy of the quoted values depends on the size of the
  remnant. For small remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of
  time and the nearest minute of arc for RA and DEC respectively. For
  the larger remnants they are rounded to coarser values. They are in
  every case sufficient to specify a point within the boundaries of the
  remnant. These coordinates are deduced from radio maps rather than
  from X-ray or optical observations, and are B1950.0.
Note on F(1GHz):
  The flux density of the remnant at !GHz in Jansky. This is not a
  measured value, but that deduced from the observed radio frequency
  spectrum of the source. The frequency of 1GHz is chosen because flux
  density measurements at frequencies both above and below this value
  are usually available.
Note on type:
  S  remnant shows a shell
  F  remnant shows a filled center
  C  remnant shows a composite or combination radiostructure
  S?, C?, F? if there is some uncertainty
  ?  object is conventionally considered a SNR although its nature is
     poorly known or not well understood.
