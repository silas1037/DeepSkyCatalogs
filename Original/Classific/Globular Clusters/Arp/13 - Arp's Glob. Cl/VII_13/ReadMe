Description:
   This catalog is the Globular Cluster Catalog published by
   Halton C. Arp in 1965 as part of a review paper on globular
   Clusters.  The review focused on the slightly more than a
   hundred roughly spherical star clusters that have integrated
   color indices between B-V = 0.6 an 0.8 mag and intrinsic
   magnitudes between Mbol = -4 and -10 mag.  They are distributed
   about the center of the galaxy. Such clusters contain stars that
   are very old and metal poor. The catalog improves upon the earlier
   publication by Mrs. Hogg (1959). An estimate of the completeness
   of the catalog is 98 percent complete for galactic latitudes
   above b(II)=8 degrees and 94 percent complete for low latitudes
   for concentration classes less than XI. This catalog lists
   for all 119 clusters: the NGC number, or other ID, the name, the
   position in equatorial and galactic coordinates, the concentration
   class, galactic absorption, diameter at 0.9, magnitude of 25-st
   brightest star, distance modulus, galactic radius, x, y, and z
   positions, total brightness, apparent and intrinsic colors,
   spectral type and radial velocity.

Note on catalog.dat:
  NGC 2158 was dropped from Mrs. Hogg's list, because although Arp and
  McCuffey (1962) have shown this to be a transitional cluster in many
  respects, it is nevertheless similar in stellar content to NCG 7789
  and NGC 752, which have been traditionally classified as galactic
  clusters. Also dropped was the so-called ''Russian cluster'' because
  under high resolution it proves to be a cluster of galaxies.
  Added was a faint, sparse globular cluster at 19h30m and -30d, a plate
  of which was found in Baade's files, and a globular cluster at low
  latitudes, NGC 6749, pictured in Setteducati and Weaver (1962), as well
  as a faint, distant cluster discovered by Arp and van den Bergh (1960).

Note on ID:
   102 globular clusters have NGC designations
   2 are listed in the Index catalogues
Note on Con_Cl:
   The roman numerals have been replaced by arabic numerals.
Note on Bmean:
   The apparent B magnitudes of the mean of the 25 brightest stars.
   Older photographic magnitudes have all been corrected using the
   photometric recalibration of the Selected Areas and the color
   index correction to the B system by Arp.
   Bmean can be used to estimate the distance of the cluster based
   on a mean intrinsic magnitude M(B) = -0.8 mag. This is used to
   derive the Dmod value.
Note on n_ID, n_Sp,n_Dmod:
   Unmarked entries of Spectral Type are from Kron and Mayal (1960)
   : uncertain value
   1 from V(hor br), table 6 in reference
   2 adjusted to RR Lyrae distance scale via figure 7 in reference
   3 Spectral type from Kinman (1959b).
   4 Kinman (1959b) gives F2
   5 Arp-Van den Bergh
   6 Kinman (1959b) gives F3
Note on Btot, M(B):
   Apparent magnitudes measured by Kron and Mayal (1960) were transformed
   into the Johnson V system, transformed color indices were applied to
   derive Btot. Absolute magnitudes M(B) were found for the clusters that
   have distances using the CSC reddening law.

   Earlier measures of integrated globular cluster magnitudes by Christie
   (Hogg 1959) can be compared to the Kron-Mayal measures. Transforming
   both measures to the B system, it can be shown that they correlate well.
   The data for 12  additional clusters based on the Christie measures
   were included.

Note on x,y,z:
   The coordinate system x,y, and z  is centered on the Sun, with x
   directed toward the galaxy center, y in the direction of the rotation,
   and z perpendicular to the plane. In order to get a coordinate system
   with its center at the center of the galaxy it is only necessary to
   substract Ro, the distance between the Sun and the center of the
   galaxy, from x.

Other parameters:
   Cluster mass. Only for 2 clusters the mass was determined based on
   the internal kinematics. These are M92 (110,000 Msun) and 47 Tuc
   (2.5 to 6 million Msun).

Remarks and Modifications:
    Arp's Globular Cluster Catalogue has been made machine-readable by Dr.
    N.P.M. Kuin at the ADC since catalog was requested frequently and the
    original version submitted by Dr. G. Share only contained ID and
    positions.
