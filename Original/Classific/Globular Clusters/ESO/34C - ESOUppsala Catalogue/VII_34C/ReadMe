Description:
    The survey is a joint project undertaken by the European Southern
    Observatory (ESO) and the Uppsala Observatory to provide a systematic
    and homogeneous search of the ESO(B) Atlas (also known as the Quick
    Blue Survey). The ESO(B) Atlas, taken with the ESO 1-m Schmidt
    telescope at La Silla, Chile, covers 606 fields from -90 to -20
    degrees of declination. The fields are similar in size and scale to
    those of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. Unsensitized IIa-O plates
    and a 2-mm GG385 filter were used to give a passband similar to the
    Johnson B color. The actual search was conducted at the Uppsala
    Observatory and resulted in a list of nonstellar objects including all
    NGC and IC galaxies between -20 and -30 degrees declination, all
    galaxies down to a limiting diameter of 1.0 arcmin, all disturbed
    galaxies as faint as possible, all star clusters in the Catalog of
    Star Clusters and Associations (Alter et al. 1970) and smaller and
    fainter clusters if recognizable and all planetary nebulae listed in
    the available catalogs.

    The catalog includes coordinates, identifications, diameters, position
    angles, morphological types, classifications, magnitudes, colors, and
    radial velocities.

Historical Notes:

  * June 1985, by Lee E. Brotzman and Robert S. Hill:

    The ESO/U catalog was sent to the Astronomical Data Center (ADC), NASA
    Goddard Space Flight Center, by the Centre de Donnees Stellaires
    (CDS), in January 1983. This version was equivalent to the book
    version of the en- tire catalog (Lauberts 1982), having two records
    per object and a separate notes file. The following changes were made
    to the catalog format:

    o  The main catalog file was reformatted to have one record per object.

    o  The object classes were placed into a consistent format.

    o  The  flags for additional information were segregated each into its
       own byte in the record.

    o  The notes file was proofread and  notes  for  individual  objects
       were placed in separate records.

    Programs were written to compare the main catalog file and the notes
    file, in order to assure that every note had a corresponding note flag
    in the main catalog, and vice versa. Discrepancies were checked
    against the lists published in the A. & A. Suppl., against the errata
    in the A. & A. Suppl., and against the book version.

    The results of this comparison and other minor corrections were sent
    to Dr. Andris Lauberts at Uppsala Observatory for confirmation and
    approval. With his reply, Dr. Lauberts supplied a tape of the then
    current version of the ESO/U catalog (dated September 9, 1984). This
    version had four records per object with a record length of 80 bytes,
    and had the notes incorporated into the catalog record. The new
    version allowed changes and updates to be made easily with a standard
    text editor.

    The processing of this new version was much the same as the previous
    one:

    o  The main catalog file was reformatted into one record per object.

    o  The object classes were placed into a consistent format.

    o  The notes were placed into a separate file to keep the record
       length of the main catalog file to a reasonable size.

    o  The programs to compare the catalog with the notes file were run
       and no discrepancies between these files remain.

    o  The files containing the references to identifications, the
       references to  magnitudes and radial velocities, and the plate
       data were made from the documentation file on the tape provided
       by Dr. Lauberts.

  * 20-Jul-1993, by F. Ochsenbein, CDS:

    The following few modifications have been made to the
    original catalogue from the ADC CD-ROM (NASA, 1991)
    "Selected Astronomical Catalogs Vol. 1":

    o  File "catalog" was transformed from the ADC CD-ROM file
       nonstell/galaxies/esoupp/esoupp.dat, and
       - the field e_Bmag/apBmag (mean error on B or aperture) has been
         transformed into two columns
       - the flags in columns 147-148 have been put in the right column
       - the flags in columns 77 and 81 were corrected to : (colon) for the
         various characters found (e.g. dots, commas, minus), and also
         for the 3 galaxies 2-G 4, 423-G 9 and 406-G 5 which had a numeric
         value in column 81 (6, 3 and 1 respectively)
       - the Hubble class started in column 86 instead of column 90 for 9
         objects at positions 023457-3424.0, 085101-3517.2, 132049-4137.6,
         052059-2757.1, 071514-2849.6, 075750-2426.0, 095433-3137.7,
         105443-3253.3, 224002-3520.0
       - values of 0.00 for e_Bmag were transformed to blanks (unknown)

    o  File "plates": records with a value of "60" in RAs or "60.0" in DEm
       have been corrected (fields 301, 306, 308, 336, 338, 425, 438, 512)

    o  Other remarks:
       - Many reference codes are included in "refs" file which never
         appear in the "catalog" file: AA, 1A, 1D, 3A, 3D, 4A, 5A, 5D, 6A,
         7A, 9A, 9D, 9F, 9G, 9H, 9J, 9L, 9M.
       - r_Bmag for 122732-6557.8 is "FW", which was only in "idrefs" file;
         it has been added to "refs" file
       - The statistics of the observer code is not consistent with those
         in "adc.doc" file. The following modifications have been made:
         "AZA" changed to "AZU"
         "BAL" and "BSL" changed to "DBA"
         "DPA" changed to "GPA"
         The results obtained from the "plates" file are then, if the 6
         additional plates are substrated:
         AZU(1)   DBA(73)   GPA(184)   HES(167)   OPA(181)

  * Documentation file revisited on 25-Oct-1995

  * 08-Jul-1998: it was discovered by Ivan Valtchanov <ivan@astro.bas.bg>
    that radial velocities larger than 9999 or smaller than -999km/s
    were truncated to the last four digits. This truncation apparently
    did not exist in the very original file supplied by A. Lauberts to
    CDS in 1982, but appears in the 1985 version created at ADC.
    The 143 velocities concerned where corrected at CDS.
    Velocities also checked versus Lauberts-Valentijn <VII/115> and PGC
    <VII/119>, and 122 further corrections on the velocities were
    performed.

Acknowledgments:
    The authors of the ADC document (Lee E. Brotzman and Robert S. Hill)
    wish to thank Dr. Lauberts for his assistance in completing the ADC
    version of the ESO/U catalog.

    A large fraction of the contents of the "ReadMe" file originates from
    the "Documentation for the machine-readable version of the ESO/Uppsala
    Survey of the ESO(B) Atlas", prepared in June 1985 by Lee E. Brotzman
    and Robert S. Hill at NASA/ADC, document SASC-T-1-5810-5003-85.
