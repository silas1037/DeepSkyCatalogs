Description:
   Halton C. Arp photographed 338 views of notable peculiar galaxies
   and published them as his 1966 "Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies."  Since
   then, galaxy catalogs have named 585 of the involved galaxies.
   This contemporary index collects names and characteristics of the
   involved objects for use by contemporary observers of the historical
   views.

Introduction:
   The galaxies identified in Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies
   represent a remarkable cross-section of observing opportunities.
   With the wide availability of inexpensive CCD cameras and increasing
   aperture of inexpensive commercial telescopes, more of the Arp list is
   accessible to more observers. Many of the objects so catalogued were
   anonymous galaxies in 1966 and have subsequently been characterized
   and named.  The NASA-IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) provided most
   correlations and other sources identified others.  Please refer to

Text describing arpord.dat:
   This file summarizes the 338 Arp "objects" in Arp sequence.  It
   includes the name either of the group or the brightest galaxy
   in the view.  Image size and orientation were derived from Arp's
   original paper.  Maximum focal lengths of optical system required
   to duplicate Arp's image using contemporary commercial CCD cameras
   are also provided to aid the imaging observer.  To find details on
   the involved galaxies, use this table to locate RA and Dec and look
   up the participating galaxies in arplist.dat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note on Name:
   The Name is the most common name of the brightest galaxy in the
   view or the common name of the group of interacting galaxies.
   Where the view is a main galaxy with companion, both names are
   indicated with the companion in abbreviated form.  The Right
   Ascension and Declination is of the brightest galaxy and not the
   center of Arp's original photo.
Note on Size:
   Size is the longest dimension of the rectangular field of view of the
   image published in Arp's 1966 Atlas.  This information is provided
   to assist the observer in framing the view for imaging.
Note on Orient:
   Orientation is the alignment of the top (narrow side) of Arp's
   original photo. For example, "E" means the published photo is a
   rectangle with the long side running east to west with east at the
   top.
Note (1):
   These three columns are the focal lengths in inches of the optical
   system necessary to duplicate Arp's original image using the named
   CCD camera.

Text describing arplist.dat:
   This table identifies all named galaxies involved in Arp's
   Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies.  It is provided in Right Ascension
   sequence with all of the galaxies in a given Arp view together.
   Occasionally a galaxy from one Arp view will intervene between
   galaxies of another Arp view, due to both Arp's location at the
   same Right Ascension.  Observational attributes for each such
   galaxy are provided as well.

Note on VT:
   Magnitude sources and types vary.  In general, where the galaxy
   appears in Uranometria, the Deep Sky Field Guide's algorithm for
   computing VT is assumed.  Where the galaxy is not so listed, a variety
   of magnitudes are used but not distinguished or recorded.  Sources
   include predominantly RC3 and PGC.

Note on MType:
   Where available, the long form mixed case Hubble morphological type
   (SB(rs)bc) is provided.  In some cases the simplified all caps form
   (IBS9P) is used.  Where no such designation was available, some sources
   provide a phrase like "disturbed", "DBL SYS" or "Multiple Sys".

Note on Uchart:
   Galaxies listed in the Uranometria 2000.0 Deep Sky Field Guide are
   indicated by reference to the chart number.  Those galaxies so listed
   which do not appear on the chart are field galaxies listed in the
   Field Guide's notes column.
