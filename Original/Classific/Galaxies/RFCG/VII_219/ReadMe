Description:

    The Flat Galaxy Catalog (FGC) is the result of a systematic search for
    disk-like  edge-on galaxies with a diameter larger than a=40arcsec and
    major-to-minor  axis ratio a/b>7 from Palomar Observatory and ESO/SERC
    surveys; it contained 4455 objects covering about 56% of the whole sky
    (Karachentsev et al., 1993AN....314...97K, see Cat. <VII/162>).

    The main reasons for  preparing  a  new,   improved  and  supplemented
    catalogue version were the following:

    - a possibility of remeasuring the coordinates of flat galaxies with a
      higher accuracy using the Digital Sky Survey;

    - the inclusion the data about "red" galaxy diameters which were
      absent earlier;

    - a reduction the diameters measured on the J and R films of the
      ESO/SERC to the diameter system of the POSS-I (near to a_25_ system)
      that eliminated the difference in photometric depth between two parts
      of the catalogue (Kudrya et al. 1997PAZh...23...15K);

    - a calculation of total apparent magnitudes (with a standard error
      about 0.25mag) for all flat galaxies basing on angular diameters,
      surface brightnesses, and other parameter data (Kudrya et al.
      1997PAZh...23..730K);

    - a possibility to determine the Galaxy absorption values in the
      region of each flat galaxy placing using new IR data (Schlegel et al.
      1998ApJ...500..525S).

    - a necessity to remove the faults noted during the work with the FGC
      data.

    The structural differences between old and new catalogue versions are:

    - both the parts, FGC and FGCE, have been joined in the RFGC (Revised
      Flat Galaxy Catalogue) where the galaxies are ranged according to
      their Right Ascensions for the epoch J2000.0;

    - the Addendum have been omitted;

    - the Notes describing concrete object characteristics have been
      included in the main corpus of the catalogue, some details were
      omitted;

    - the lists of identification of the FGC and the FGCE galaxies have
      been omitted because these data are accessible now due to different
      galaxy databases (NED, LEDA etc).

Note on RFGC: the galaxies having reduced diameters a(O) less than 0.6arcmin
     are included in the catalogue without new RFGC number.
Note on aO, bO: for FGCE galaxies the conversion from the ESO/SERC
     diameter system (J) to the POSS-I one (O) have been made according to
     the formulae: a(O) = 0.80788 a(J), b(O) = 0.7827 b(J);
Note on aE, bE: for FGCE galaxies the conversion from the ESO/SERC
     diameter system (R) to the POSS-I one (E) have been made according to
     the formulae: a(E) = 0.8640 a(R),  b(E) = 0.9730 b(R);
Note on MType: morphological type of spiral according to the Hubble
     classification. Note that Sb = 3, Sc = 5 etc in number designation;
Note on As: 0 means poorly defined, 2 = pronounced
Note on SB: The index varies from I = high to IV = very low surface brightness
Note on N: N is the number of significant neighbours with angular diameter in
     the range from aO/2 to 2*aO in a circle of R=10*aO
Note on Notes: Notes describing the galaxy morphological peculiarities
     and/or the galaxy environment. The  non-significant companion galaxy
     diameters and mutual distances are expressed in arcmin.
