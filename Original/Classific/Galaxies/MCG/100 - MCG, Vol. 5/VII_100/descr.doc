            In the Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory the work has
       been completed on the transfer of the fifth volume of the Morpho-
       logical Catalogue of Galaxies (MCG) (Vorontsov-Velyaminov et al.,
       1974) on the magnetic tape. 1637 galaxies, probably no fainter
       than the 14-th magnitude, were included in this volume.
            The fifth volume, as the previous four volumes of MCG cata-
       logue, was compiled on the basis of the Palomar sky atlas prints
       and comprises areas from -30 deg to -45 deg in declination. However, as
       distinguished from the first four volumes, the fifth one was
       based on the prints, taken only in red light. So visual estima-
       tions of magnitudes of galaxies are presented here in red colour.
       it should be noted that in all cases, when in MCG or other sour-
       ces the magnitudes of galaxies are encountered in photographic or
       photoelectric b system, we gave preference to these values com-
       pared to Vorontsov-Velyaminov's estimates.
            As in the case of previous volumes we've put also on the mag-
       netic tape all the notes to galaxies in the system, described
       earlier (Kogoshvili, 1983). Besides, we've used following data
       from the ESO/Uppsala survey (Lauberts, 1982): magnitudes, colours,
       radial velocities, hubble types and galaxy diameters, measured on
       the ESO(b) atlas plates up to the surface brightness slightly
       fainter than 25 magnitude per square arc sec. These maximum major
       and minor galaxy diameters in the fifth volume are given on the
       magnetic tape in columns 86-90 and 92-96 for each galaxy. In these
       columns, in case of the first four volumes, diameters of galaxies
       from UGC catalogue were put. Besides, we used various data from
       both reference catalogues of bright galaxies (De Vaucouleurs et
       al., 1964, 1976) and b-v and u-b colours from the general cata-
       logue of photoelectric magnitudes and colours (longo et al., 1983).
            Some slight additions, connected with the transfer of the
       data from the fifth volume on the magnetic tape, were included in
       the detailed description of the merged catalogue, put in the first
       file. The second file of this catalogue consists of 1675 re-
       cords for 1675 galaxies. The record length for each galaxy is
       the same as in the previous merged catalogue or 376 bytes.
            The reference list is also supplemented by new literature
       entries, contained in the fourth file.

The following is a description of a revised version of the catalog. The catalog
had contained many blank data fields. These were removed, reducing the record
length to 280 bytes.
