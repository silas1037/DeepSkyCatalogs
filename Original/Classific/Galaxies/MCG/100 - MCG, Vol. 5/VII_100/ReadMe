Description:
    The Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies, Volume 5
    (Vorontsov-Velyaminov et al. 1974) includes 1637 galaxies, probably no
    fainter than the fourteenth magnitude. The catalog was based on
    Palomar Sky Atlas prints and comprises areas from -30 to -45 degrees
    in declination. In contrast to the earlier four volumes of the
    catalog, the fifth was based on the red prints of the Sky Survey only.
    Visual magnitude estimates are thus in the red. Note that in all cases
    when in other sources the photoelectric B or photographic magnitude of
    galaxies are encountered, preference to those values has been given
    over those of Vorontsov-Velyaminov's estimates. All notes to galaxies
    published in the earlier volume are included here as well (Kogoshvili
    1983). In addition, the following data were used from the ESO/Uppsala
    survey (Lauberts 1982): magnitudes, colors, radial velocities, Hubble
    types, and galaxy diameters as measured on the ESO(B) atlas plates up
    to the surface brightness slightly fainter than 25 magnitudes per
    square arcsec. These maximum major and minor galaxy diameters are
    provided in the fifth volume in place of the values taken from the UGC
    catalog in the earlier four volumes. Various data from both the
    reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1964) and
    B-V and U-B colors from the General Catalogue of Photoelectric
    Magnitudes and Colours (Longo et al. 1983) were included. Fields
    included in the catalog are identification number; zone sign, number,
    and field number; galaxy number in the field; component or symbolic
    designation; NGC or IC identification; B1950.0 position, magnitude,
    magnitude accuracy, and magnitude reference; angular diameters,
    surface brightness, symbolic description galaxy, morphological type,
    galaxy type, heliocentric radial velocity; radial velocity corrected
    for solar motion; rotational velocity, dates of first two supernovae,
    number of supernovae, number of H II regions, U-B and B-V colors and
    references, radio flux densities at 178, 780, 1400, 2700, and 5000
    MHz; number of nearby cluster; and coded information on membership of
    the galaxy to double or multiple systems, interaction features, and
    faint components.
