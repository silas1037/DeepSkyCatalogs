                                  ABSTRACT


   Detailed descriptions of modifications, corrections and the record format
are provided for the machine-readable version of the "Morphological Catalogue
of Galaxies" (Vorontsov-Velyaminov et al. 1962-68). In addition to hundreds of
individual corrections, a detailed comparison of the machine-readable with the
published catalogue resulted in the addition of 116 missing objects, the
deletion of 10 duplicate records, and a format modification to increase storage
efficiency.

   The "Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies" (MCG) is a compilation of
information for approximately 34,000 galaxies found and examined on the Palomar
Observatory Sky Survey (POSS). Individual identifiers are assigned for about
29,000 galaxies and information on the remaining 5,000 is present in the
extensive notes of the published catalogues (Vorontsov-Velyaminov et al.
1962-1968). The catalogue is structured according to the POSS zones and is
numbered from +15 (corresponding to +90 deg) to +01 (+06 deg zone) and +00
(equatorial zone) to -05 (-30 deg zone); the fields are numbered with
increasing right ascension. The original goal of the compilation was to be
complete for galaxies brighter than magnitude 15.1, but the final catalogue
lists many objects considerably fainter.

   Information given in the original printed volumes includes:  cross-identifi-
cations to the NGC (Dreyer 1888) and IC (Dreyer 1895, 1908) catalogues,
equatorial coordinates for 1950.0, magnitude, estimated sizes and intensities
of the bright inner region and the entire object, estimated inclination, and
coded description (by symbols) of the appearance of the galaxy.  Each field is
then followed by notes on individual objects.  All of the above data except
the coded description are included in the machine version, except that special
coding (e.g. for uncertainty or source designation) is not present (other than
for the NGC/IC cross identifications [added at the Astronomical Data Center
for this machine version]).  Although the notes are not computerized, the
presence of a note in the original is flagged in the machine version.

    This document describes in detail the machine-readable version of the MCG
currently being distributed from the Astronomical Data Center. It is intended
to enable users to read and process the data without problems or guesswork. For
additional details concerning the galaxy classifications, measurements, and
descriptions, the source references should be consulted. A copy of this
document should accompany any machine-readable copy of the catalogue.

    A byte-by-byte description of the contents of the machine-readable MCG is
given in Table 1. The suggested format specifications are for FORTRAN formatted
read statements and can be modified depending upon individual programming and
processing requirements. Since all data fields contain blanks for missing data
(only the MCG and coordinate fields are never blank) care must be exercised
when processing the catalogue for search or computational purposes (the
situation is simplified here because there are no data with valid zero values).
Alternate format specifications are given in parentheses.

The information contained in Table 2 is sufficient for a user to describe the
indigeneous characteristics of the machine-readable MCG to a computer.
Information easily varied from installation to installation, such as block
size (physical record length), blocking factor (number of logical records per
physical record), total number of blocks, tape density, number of tracks, and
internal coding (EBCDIC, ASCII, etc.) is not included.  That information
should always be transmitted if secondary copies are supplied to other users
or installations on tape.

The machine readable version of the MCG was received from Dr. Robert S. Dixon
of the Ohio State University Radio Observatory on 7 December 1981. As
received, the catalogue consisted of 28904 records of length 90 bytes. Each
logical record contained a number giving the approximate sequential position of
the object in the original published catalogue volumes, but the machine version
was ordered by right ascension. Upon listing the data and scanning some records
manually, enough errors were found such that it was deemed necessary to check
the records more closely.

The catalogue was sorted by MCG number from north to south to obtain the
published order.  Further checking revealed many hundreds of records in the
MCG-01 zone with MCG+01 in bytes 1-6.  At this time it was decided to review
the published version in order to compare certain data items in detail, e.g.
the "a, b, ..." suffixes on MCG and NGC/IC numbers, the NCG and NGC/IC numbers
themselves, and the number of galaxies in each region.  A complete count of
the number of objects in each region was performed manually by scanning the
published volumes and adding suffixed records to the highest number in each
region.  (This procedure was complicated by the fact that while one region
might have the sequence ..., 15, 16a, 16b, 17, ..., another has ..., 15, 16,
16a, 16b, I7, ... ) Following some initial corrections and the addition of an
uncertainty symbol (:) to NGC/IC identifications (in place of ? in the
published catalogue) [since it is important to know about such uncertainties
when using the catalogue for source identification] a computer program was
written to make a count of the objects in each region, to count the total
number of regions with at least one object, and to list all suffixed objects
along the way (these had also been recorded during the manual count).  The
initial run on the partially corrected version gave 28950 objects in 824
occupied regions, while the manual count gave 29003 objects.  A region-by-
region count comparison revealed 26 regions with discrepant counts.  The
discrepancies were checked and individually resolved.  Most corrections
involved duplicate records and erroneous MCG numbers (two occupied regions
were added due to the omission of MCG+10-01-001 and the correction of the
MCG+05-40 records to MCG+05-41).  The individual corrections found during the
catalogue analysis are listed in Table 3.  In addition to correcting the
tabulated items, the following changes were made to the machine-readable
version in order to make it more uniform, self-consistent, and storage
efficient:

1.  Many NGC and IC numbers were not right justified or were misaligned in the
    data field; these were corrected in 125 cases.  The two bytes following
    the NGC/IC field were not uniform in content (asterisks were usually in
    the byte following the NGC/IC number, but sometimes not if an A or B were
    present; or sometimes the A, B, ... followed the NGC/IC number and the
    asterisk was in the next byte.  Question marks (?) were present following
    two NGC numbers.  The question marks were changed to colons and colons
    were added to 111 NGC/IC numbers as a result of the catalogue review.  All
    components identifications (A, B, ...) were changed to lower case to agree
    with the published catalogue.

 2.  The presence of preceding zeroes on NGC and IC numbers was not consistent,
     so all preceding zeroes were deleted.  Although not important for reading
     the data, the records would not sort properly if a sort were performed on
     NGC and IC numbers.

 3.  Approximately five hundred MCG-01 records having erroneous plus (+) signs
     were corrected.

 4.  The format was modified by deleting all unused bytes (except the one
     between degrees and minutes of declination) and removing the sequential
     numbers (which were not correct in many cases where MCG numbers were
     corrected, thereby moving the record location, and which are no longer
     needed because the catalogue is now in published order).

 5.  Following all corrections, the modified catalogue was resorted in MCG
     published order.  If needed for possible source identifications by right
     ascension searches, the records can easily be sorted by RA.

 6.  NGC and IC catalogue designations were added to the numbers, eliminating
     the asterisk which had indicated the IC catalogue designation. This
     change added three bytes to the record length.
