ABSTRACT
     A Catalogue of  galaxies  with  UV-continuum  (Markarian  galaxies
detected    during   the   First   Byurakan   Survey   (FBS)  is   pre-
sented.  The purpose  of  the  Survey  was   to  search  for   peculiar
faint   extragalactic objects  with  UV-excess  radiation  and to study
them. The procedure of observations and processings, the Survey  areas,
the   object  selection  and  classification    criteria    and    also
several  selection  effects  are described.  The Catalogue contains the
following  initial data on all the objects:  the  precise  coordinates,
visual magnitudes, angular sizes, redshifts and  classification  types.
The  observational   results   of   slit  spectra,  UBV-photometry, IR-
photometry (IRAS  data),  morphology  and  some  other  data  are  also
included  into  the  Catalogue.    While  compiling  the Catalogue  the
authors introduced some necessary corrections in the data of the   ear-
lier   published  lists  on  galaxies  with  UV-continuum.  In addition
we  included the objects with numbers 1501-1515. In most cases they are
well-known  Seyfert galaxies  omitted  by  the  authors  in  the lists,
but  detected  on the plates.   41  objects  from  our  lists  are  not
included  into  the  Catalogue,  since  they  are  either stars of  our
Galaxy or   star  projections   on   the   galaxies.    The   Catalogue
presents  the  largest  homogeneous sample of AGN of different types on
the northern sky for bright objects (<16.0). Up to the middle  of  1987
the  redshifts  were  measured  for  1459   out  of 1469 objects of the
Catalogue.

1. THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST BYURAKAN SURVEY

     Studying the results of the surface photometry  carried  out  from
1958   to  1962   and  comparing  them  with the spectra of the central
parts of the same galaxies, Markarian  (1963)    concluded   that   the
colours   of   the central  parts  of a great number of galaxies do not
correspond to their morphological types, i. e.  the central parts  were
bluer  than   those   of normal  galaxies  of  the  same  Hubble  type.
The compiled sample of 41 objects included  8 galaxies, marked by  Sey-
fert  in   1943,   whose   nuclei showed bright and wide (some thousand
km/s) emission lines. Therefore, a hypothesis has   been   made   (Mar-
karian,   1963)   on   possible non-thermal character of radiation from
the nuclei of some studied galaxies.

     In order to confirm this hypothesis at  the  end  of   1964   Mar-
karian  began   the   search  for  the galaxies showing an excess of UV
radiation in their central parts. All the observations were carried out
with the  40" Schmidt  telescope  of Byurakan observatory. On Markarian
initiative two additional 1.5  and 3   prisms  were  prepared  and  the
telescope   optics   was   changed  for  the new one, corrected for the
blue- violet spectrum region. It was the first successful experiment of
using  a   small-angle   objective  prism  in  search for extragalactic
objects.  It should be noted, that  an  objective  prism  was  success-
fully  used  in astronomy   since  the  beginning  of  the  XX  century
for  spectral classification of stars.  High resolution  prisms  having
angles   in   the range  of 8-12  and a reciprocal linear dispersion of
100-250 A/mm at H   were commonly used. The spectra were widened up  to
0.3-0.5 mm,  the telescope  losses  being 8-10 , as  compared  with the
direct photography.  Therefore, for  studying  of  the  faint  galaxies
this  procedure  was worthless.

     Markarian used a prism of  low  dispersion  (1800  A/mm   at   H )
and  obtained   unwidened  spectra  on  which  the  galaxy  nuclei were
easily detectable on the background of the  surrounding  matter,  espe-
cially   if  an UV-continuum excess was present in it.  A high spectral
resolution was not required for spectral classification and the  limit-
ing  magnitude  on the searching plate reached 17-17.5 .

     In 1965-1966 70 new galaxies  with   strong   UV-continuum   (Mar-
karian,  1967,  1968)  were  detected. The detected objects got further
the names "Markarian galaxies".   During   the   following   years  two
more  lists  of galaxies  with  strong  UV-continuum (Markarian, 1969a,
b) were compiled and their general number became 302.

     In 1969 Markarian and  Lipovetsky  have  iniciated  a  full  spec-
tral survey  of  the  northern  sky in the high galactic latitudes (The
First Byurakan Survey - FBS).

     The purpose of the  Survey  was  to  select  the   galaxies   with
UV-  continuum    and   to  look  for  active  galactic  nuclei  (AGN),
i.  e.  preliminary spectral classification of  all  of  them.   During
the   Survey the  quasar  candidates among stellar objects and the blue
stars of high galactic latitudes were marked  also.  The  observational
program   of   the  FBS   was   completed  in  1978.   The  studying of
plates, the search and selection of objects were continued up to 1980.

     More than  2500  photographic  plates  were  obtained  and   about
40 millions spectral images were visually examined. The survey consists
of 1133 fields of 4 x4  in size and covered the sky  area   of    17000
square  degrees.  FBS,  the  first  survey  in  the  world, carried out
with the purpose of search for active galaxies, was  for   many   years
the  single source for new Sy galaxies and other types of AGN.

     Among  Markarian galaxies  there  are   quasi-stellar  objects, Sy
galaxies, BL Lacs, sources of radio, IR and X-ray emissions.

     The main results of the Survey are published  in  the  series   of
15  papers   including  1500  objects  (Markarian  1967, 1969a, b; Mar-
karian, Lipovetsky, 1971, 1972, 1973,  1974,  1976a,  b;  Markarian  et
al.,  1977a, b; 1979a, b, c; 1981).

     Besides obtaining the survey plates and object selections  it  was
very important to get their slit spectra as well.
     The  first  spectral  observations,  carried  out  in  USA  (Weed-
man,  Khachikian,  1968,  1969), have led to the detection  of 8 new Sy
galaxies and have shown a high efficiency of the   used   search   pro-
cedure.   Since  1969,  parallel   to  the  Survey, the  authors  began
regular  spectral observations in order to find out the physical nature
of  the  detected galaxies.

     Before 1977 the slit spectra of Markarian galaxies were   obtained
in  the   USSR   mainly  with the three telescopes: 1.25-m of the South
Station of Sternberg  Astronomical  institute;  2.6-m  of  the  Crimean
astrophysical  observatory, and  0.7-m, of the Astrophysical institute,
Alma-Ata. Since 1977 the main  part  of   spectral   observations   was
made   with  the  6-m telescope  of  SAO  USSR  AS. The spectra of more
than 600 galaxies were obtained. In all, the authors have obtained  the
spectra   of   about   1200  objects   of  FBS. Some of them were reob-
served, because the observations made with small  telescopes  sometimes
had not the necessary  quality  for redshift determination. Thus, up to
nowadays there are spectral data for almost all galaxies.

     The successful use of  an  objective  prism  for  studying   faint
objects  iniciated  a  new  direction in extragalactic astronomy - sys-
tematic search for new objects using  a  low-dispersion   spectroscopy.
This   method  was intensively used in the whole world surveys such as:
Cerro-Tololo Survey (Smith, 1975;  Smith  et  al.,   1976;   MacAlpine,
Lewis,  1978),  Michigan Survey  (MacAlpine et al., 1977a, b, c,); Case
Survey (Pesch, Sanduleak, 1983;  Sanduleak,  Pesch,  1984;  1987),  the
Survey   of   emission   galaxies  (Wasilewski,   1983).   Most  widely
this  method  was  used  with large telescopes when a grism for  search
for  quasars  was  designed  (Hoag, 1976).

     During the last 20 years several  hundred   papers   appeared   in
which  they   reported   the   data on study of Markarian galaxies. For
futher investigations of these  objects  a  combined   catalogue   with
main  observational   data   is  necessary.  It  is  also  necessary to
correct various errors  that  appeared   during   the   performing   of
such   large  program.   Such  a  catalogue  was  recently  compiled by
Mazzarella and Balzano (1986).  It includes  a  part  of  observational
data,  and  a  wide bibliography  on  Markarian  galaxies. In this con-
nection the authors do not present all the  references  in   order   to
avoid   duplicating.   Our  Catalogue  contains  the  main  information
presented in the lists (but corrected  and  supplemented)  of  original
data  on   spectra   available   for  99 %  of   objects.   A  detailed
description  of FBS and some statistical results of the  investigation,
made   on   the   basis   of  the  Catalogue, concerning   the   Survey
completeness,  luminosity  function,  spatial distribution, search  for
different  types  of  AGN and etc.  were  reported by Lipovetsky (1986,
1987), Lipovetsky et al. (1987).

     It should be noticed also that at present a  second  part  of  the
Survey  data   is  being prepared. It will include blue stellar objects
which were selected earlier by us. Their number totals some thousands.

     The continuation of the FBS  is   the   Second   Byurakan   Survey
(SBS)  carried   out  in  the  Byurakan  observatory (Markarian et al.,
1983a).  The data of 6  fields  are   published   already   (Markarian,
Stepanian,   1983, 1984a,  b;  Markarian et al., 1985b, 1986; Stepanian
et al., 1987).  All the fields are 4 x4  in size and locate in   =+59 ,
+55 ,  +51 .  The   work  on compiling the Catalogue of SBS objects has
been already begun.

     Below we describe the procedure of observations and   processings,
the  Survey   areas,   the   object  selection  and classification cri-
teria, the selection effects and the Catalogue of Markarian galaxies.

     The Catalogue of FBS objects is the result of the long time  work.
The  work   was   still   in   progress  when  in  1985 B. E. Markarian
died. The authors concluded the  compilation  of  the  Catalogue  which
they  dedicated to the memory of their teacher.


2. OBSERVATIONS AND PROCESSING

     All the observational data (low-dispersion plates)  were  obtained
with  the  40-52"  Schmidt telescope of the Byurakan observatory in the
period from 1965 till 1978. This  instrument  is  the  most  fast   one
among  other large Schmidt telescopes. Its main parameters are:
     - the aperture of the main mirror is 1300 mm;
     - the focal length - 2123 mm;
     - the aperture of the corrector - 1000 mm;
     - the scale - 97"/mm;
     - non-vignetted angular field - 4 x 4 ;
     - the maximum size of the photographic plates - 160x160 mm;
     - three objective prisms: 1.5 , 3 , 4  with an aperture of 1000 mm.

     Due to a Piazzi-Smith lens  the  telescope  has  a   flat   field.
The  optics   is   made   of  uviol  glass  and  the  optical system is
corrected for the blue spectrum range.  The objective prisms can rotate
in  the  position angle,  that allows to obtain spectra of any orienta-
tion. As a rule, for the  Survey a  1.5  prism  with  a  dispersion  of
1800 A/mm at H   was used.

     All plates were obtained  on   panchromatic   emulsions   of   "F"
type.   Different   modifications  of  emulsions  (Kodak  IIAF, Eastman
Kodak AF, 103aF, IIF) were used since the Survey continued for   rather
long  time.   The  authors   tried  to use the plates with most similar
spectral sensitivity, because even small variations  could  cause  some
selection  effects.   Table  1  presents all the types of the emulsions
used  and  their characteristics.  In order to preserve the homogeneity
of data, different plates were calibrated on the same objects.

     The plates were visually examined  (entire  scanning)  using   7
lens.   All   the   suspected   peculiar   spectra  were  marked; these
spectra were  compared  with  Palomar  Observatory  Sky  Survey  (POSS)
charts.

     Such a procedure   allows   to   take   into   consideration   the
spectrum  overlaps,  plate  deffects,  and also to compare spectral and
direct images.

     Comparing three images (spectral and  direct  on  the   blue   and
red  Palomar   charts)  we  succeeded  in  selecting  the most compact,
almost starlike galaxies, which were impossible to find using only  one
direct  image.  The  description  of  objects  in  this case is as fol-
lows: "the object does not differ from a star, but the  spectral  image
is   slightly  inferior   to   stars  in  intensity".  It  was possible
owing to the high contrast of Palomar charts and the presence of a high
gradient   on  the spectral  images.   Such  are  the  features of many
distant Sy galaxies (z>0.06) and near QSO.

     The  whole  Survey  was  performed  in  several  stages  by  three
observers.   The  main  verification  of plates, as a rule, was made by
one observer; the classification of objects was done by all together.

     While compiling the next lists we  used  only  the  data  verified
using  the available   plates;   therefore,  the  published  data  were
incomplete according  to  all  the  main  parameters  of  the  objects:
location,  brightness,   spectral   types and etc. This fact was always
emphasized by the authors in publications, because   such   incomplete-
ness  could  cause serious errors in statistical data analysis.

     The coordinates of the selected  objects  were  measured  on  POSS
charts  using   the  reference bright stars and galaxies from Zwicky et
al. (1961- 1967) with  the  known  coordinates.  The  accuracy  of  the
coordinate  determination   was   1'  in  declination, and 0.1 in right
ascension. The angular sizes of objects were  determined  on  red  POSS
charts,  using   10 lens.  The  general description of objects was made
from both spectral and direct images.


3. THE SURVEY AREAS AND ITS STRUCTURE

     The Survey was carried out in  two   sky   areas,   northern   and
southern  galactic   hemispheres.  The  lower Survey boundary was     =
-11 (b    >0 ) and   =-15  (b  >0 ). It covers the sky zones of  4   in
width,  located  in declination;  each  zone  consists  of fields equal
to the plate size of 4 x 4  (full plate size is 4 20'). The field over-
lap  is 10'- 30'.  The  prism was  oriented  so  that  the spectra were
locating along the declination axis in order  to  diminish  the   tele-
scope  guiding  influence  on  the spectral resolution.

     The Survey areas and the number of fields in each zone are   given
in Table 2.

     Above the given areas  the  whole  sky  was   observed   in   high
galactic  latitudes   (b  >30 ).   In   the   area  free  from Galactic
absorption the Survey covers up to b   =25-30 , in  some  cases  up  to
about  b   10 .   Due  to technical  reasons  the pole area is observed
in the zone +88 30' with a large overlap and the area higher  than    =
+75 ,   in   this   connection,  is shifted  by  1  to the south. About
2500  plates were obtained during the Survey.

4. PARAMETERS OF THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL CLASSIFICATION
   OF GALAXIES WITH  UV-CONTINUUM

     The selection procedure, suggested by  Markarian  (1967),  is  the
most  outstanding  one  by  its  efficiency  and  simplicity. As a main
search feature Markarian  suggested to use the intensity of UV emission
of  a  galaxy.  In  this   way   selected   are  the  objects  with  an
excess,  for  their morphological  type,  UV-emission  in  the  central
parts  or  nuclei.  So,  more exactly, one ought to name them "galaxies
with an excess UV-continuum".

     Visual search for objects is rather simple and is   performed   on
the  basis  of  spectral  and direct images. It is necessary to have at
least one spectral plate and two POSS charts. Both spectral  and   mor-
phological  features   are  used  in this procedure. The classification
features were suggested by Markarian (1967, 1969 a, b).
   The classification parameters are as follows:

    - the degree of emission condensation to the galaxy centre;

    - the intensity of UV-emission in the region shorter than 4000 A;

    - some auxiliary features.

-------------------------------------------------------------

     The first parameter is determined by the  object  profile   widths
on low-dispersion  plates  and  is designated by characters: "s" (stel-
lar), "d" (diffuse) and their intermediate ones "sd" or "ds".

     The objects with star-like nuclei or  almost   star-like   objects
are  reffered   to  "s" type. On plates of a good quality the halfwidth
of the brightness profiles for such objects is of the order of 2".

     The objects whose brightness profiles have halfwidths   of   6"-8"
and  more,   depending  on  the  galaxy size, are reffered to "d" type.
While selecting this type the most difficult  problem  is  to   exclude
irregular  galaxies   Irr I.   For  them  the  main  feature is  almost
"flat" profile without narrowing to UV spectral part,  since   emission
goes  from  the large disk, but not from the nucleus.

     In this classification intermediate types "s/sd", "ds/d" and  etc.
are  used   as   well.   The  estimations  of two experienced observers
differ not more  than  1  subclass.  Evidently,  there  is   a   strong
influence   of   bad  images  on  this parameter, thus, the observer is
obliged to compare the dimness of a galactic nucleus  with  that  of  a
star.

     The second classification  parameter,   the   intensity   of   UV-
emission  from  the nucleus or the central part of a galaxy, is charac-
terized by correlation of red and blue spectrum part  lengths  on  pan-
chromatic   emulsion   (which   are  separated   by the fall-off in the
green). For A0-A2 star with Kodak IIAF emulsion (England)  these  parts
have equal extension. According to  their UV  intensity all the objects
are divided into 3 classes: 1, 2, 3. Class I - the blue spectrum  part;
it  is  one and a half times longer  than  the red  one.  Class 3 - the
lengths of these two parts are equal, class 2 - intermediate.

     The procedure is rather correct for similar spectral sensitivities
of  plates.   The   coorelation   of  the  blue  and  red spectral part
lengths slightly depends on the object  brightness,  it  is  determined
by   the  spectrum   slope.  When  using  other  types of emulsions, as
Kodak IIaO, IIIaJ, which have no green fall-off, the search is  greatly
complicated.

     In this case it is necessary to use another parameter,   that   is
the  spectrum   length  which  strongly  depends  on the object bright-
ness. In general  one ought to consider the  energy   distribution   in
the   whole  wavelength  range  being  under study. The spectrum can be
represented as a totality of 20-40 independent  points  (at  1800  A/mm
dispersion at H ).

     Besides two main classification  parameters  a  number  of   auxi-
liary features are used:

 - existence of emission: "e, e:" - sure  or suspected emission. It is
   called an auxiliary one because it cannot be a selection criterium.
   On our  spectra  the  following  emission  lines or line groups are
   distinguished: H  + [NII]    6548/84,  H  + [OIII]    4959+5007,
   H ,  [OII] 3726/29.

 - difference  of the  energy  distribution  from  the  thermal one. An
   asterisk  marks  a candidate  into  Sy type  galaxy; two asterisks -
   a candidate into QSO.

 - additional  features,  which  are  usually  presented  in the object
   description,  for  instance,  morphological  features,  inherence to
   multiple systems, interaction features, etc.

     This classification scheme is now accepted as a basic one in  most
of  survey   works.  It  allows  easily  to  introduce  new  parameters
for description  of  emission  lines  and  include  new  subclasses  of
objects.  So,  for  example,  in the Second Byurakan Survey the authors
have introduced a new  type  of  emission  line  galaxies  without  UV-
continuum: se, de.

     The considered classification scheme used in searching  for  pecu-
liar  objects  allows  to  select  a great number of different types of
them:
   - galaxies with UV-continuum;

   - emission galaxies of all kinds (HII galaxies also including);

   - emission parts of bright galaxies (association; HII regions);

   - star-like nuclei of bright galaxies;

   - blue stars with B-V > 0  and U-B < -0.5  (white dwarfs of DA-DF
     types);

   - QSO candidates;

   - star-like galaxies with emission lines;

   - some variables with flat spectra, especially of U Gem type;

   - anomalous red stars (late M, R, S,), carbon stars;

   - planetary nebulae.

     Due to a large amount of data available and difficulties in selec-
tion  of  objects  of   all types in a reasonable short time delay, the
Survey authors  limited themthelves by the following types of objects:

1.   Galaxies with UV-continuum with m   13.0. It should be  noticed,
     that   in   the  original  lists of  objects  the  well-known  ob-
     jects  have  been omitted;

2.   Bright galaxies with UV-continuum  or  star-like  nuclei  with  UV-
     continuum and m<13 , if there was a lack of spectral information at
     the moment of publication.

3.   QSO candidates and quasi-stellar galaxies.


5. SELECTION EFFECTS

     One of the  main  tasks  of  spectral  surveys  is  the   creation
of  a representative sample of objects with definite properties. There-
fore, it is very important first to reveal, study, and, if possible, to
take  into  consideration   a  great number of selection effects. Among
them there can be regular factors (for example, a dependence of  limit-
ing   magnitude  on the  declination of an object due to differences in
zenith distances and noticeable illumination of the night  sky  in  the
south  of  the  Byurakan observatory), and casual (the plate center has
appeared out of focus due to its deflection). The factors may be objec-
tive  (the  sizes  of  emulsion grain  increase  due to its ageing) and
subjective (the observer prefers stellar  objects  to  extended  ones).
There   are   effects  which  can  be easily taken into account (casual
spectrum projecting on each other) and which  are  difficult  to  allow
for   (an  influence  of  variable  UV- transparence of atmosphere onto
classification of UV-continuum).

     We describe the  main  selection  factors  and  as  far  as   pos-
sible  estimate the degree of their influence. We divided them into two
groups:

---------------------------------------------------------
* Note:  A second part of the Survey will include blue stellar objects also.

   -     factors, which influence the number of detected objects;

   -     factors, which change their parameters.

   To the first group we may refer the following selection effects.

     5.1. An effect of the plate limit

     This is one of the most unpleasant selection factors   in   survey
works.  There  are  some  reasons which cause essential inhomogeneities
of plate  quality  (emulsion  type,  atmosphere   transparency,   image
quality).   In this  work we had no opportunity to determine the limit-
ing magnitude for each plate. Such estimate was made only occasionally,
for  instance,  when  using  another  type  of  emulsion.  This  effect
manifests  it  in the "spotted" galaxy distribution  on  the  celestial
sphere.  When  the   surface  distribution  is  studied a dispersion of
galaxy numbers in the areas of about 4 x4  in  size  increases  notice-
ably.   The  effect  is   observed   also  in areas of 4 x8 , since the
neighbour, according to the right  ascension,  fields  have  been  very
often  observed at the same night. A  great  number of  our plates have
the limiting magnitude within the range 16.0 -17.0, and only in  excep-
tional  cases  up  to  15.0  or  17.5.   Allowing  for  other selection
effects  the  objects brighter than 1-1.5 the  limit are detected  with
confidence.

     This effect cannot be  practically   taken   into   consideration.
When studying  the surface and spatial distribution of Markarian galax-
ies one ought to  compile  carefully  the  samples  allowing  for   the
reported   one.   The objects fainter than 16.5  are, as a rule, worth-
less for statistical investigation.  A "working"  sample   may  include
objects up to 15.5 -15.7 (the  limit  of  Zwicky  catalogue) a "strict"
one must contain galaxies brighter than 15.0.

     5.2. Zenith distance effect

     This is also an  effect  of  the   plate   limit,   but   is   its
"regular"  component.  It is caused by three factors: by strong illumi-
nation of the night sky in the south-east of the Byurakan  observatory,
by  the towns of Erevan  and Ashtarak, by deterioration of the image at
noticeable zenith distances, by decrease of UV-transparency (cutting of
the  blue   spectrum  end).  The  two last reasons influence the object
distribution according to their types as well.  For statistical  inves-
tigations  it  is   necessary  to   limit  the  sample  in  declination
approximately up to   =0  for the areas in the south and    =75   -  in
the  north.    The   last  limitation  is caused  by  the  position  of
the Galactic plane and noticeable spectra widened on the plate  due  to
field  rotation  (errors  of  the  telescope polar axis installation).

     5.3. "Stellar nucleus" effect

     This rather specific effect is caused by the fact  that  star-like
nuclei  of   bright  galaxies were included into the Survey. It is evi-
dent that a galaxy of 13 , with a nucleus of 16-17 ,  is   already   at
the   detection limit.   The  number  of  such objects depends upon the
magnitude of the whole galaxy. This effect exists  within   the   whole
range  of  apparent magnitudes.   So,  in  order to establish  a  homo-
geneous  sample  up  to  the  given limiting magnitude the objects with
large  differences  in  galaxy and nucleus brightness should  be  omit-
ted.  As  a  rule  such  objects  had the following description in  the
lists:  "starlike  nucleus  of  a  bright galaxy,  the  data  refer  to
the  nucleus".  However, the number of such objects in the Catalogue is
relatively small (a few percents).

     5.4. Star projection effect

     This effect, contrary  to  the  previous   ones,   increases   the
number   of  selected  objects.  It  consists  in the following: a star
with a rather early spectrum is projected onto the region of the center
of   a   galaxy creating  an impression of a powerful star-like object;
or images of 2-3 close stars make an impression of a  compact   galaxy.
This   effect   is rather  strong  at  low latitudes and is fully taken
into account in the spectral observations. All  such  objects  are  not
included   into   the  Catalogue.  Markarian  914 is out also; it is an
emission star related  to LkH   233 nebula. It is evident that  projec-
tion  of  a star onto the galaxy may cause an object loss while search-
ing. Though the probability of this fact  is  small,  nevertheless,  we
note  that  due  to  this reason a good Sy 1 galaxy - Arakelyan 564 was
lost. Its nucleus spectrum is masked  with  the  bright  star,  located
northward.

     5.5. Image quality influence on condensation degree

     The effect reveals itself in two ways: uncertainty in  classifica-
tion   of  "s/sd"   objects   if   the   images   are  of  poor quality
("ds/d" estimate becomes more probable), and also the loss  of  fainter
star-like   objects  due   to   their   contrast  decrease  by spectral
enlargement. In both cases the  number  of  "s/sd"  objects  among  all
objects has decreased.

     5.6. Zenith distance influence on UV-continuum estimate

     A  decrease  of  UV-transparency  of  the  atmosphere   with   the
increase   of  zenith   distance  influences  the UV-intensity estimate
and leads to its systematic underestimation at great zenith distances.

     The influence of this and the previous effect is shown in Fig.  3.
It presents the number of different classification types depending upon
the declination.

     5.7. "Observer" effect

     All  plates  were  examined  by three observers:  B. E. Markarian,
V. A.  Lipovetsky,   and  J. A. Stepanian.   Although  their  estimates
are in agreement, a  "selection"  effect  remains.   Our   observations
have   shown that  the  "observer" effect in FBS is rather small and in
most cases it can be neglected.  A good  agreement  of  our   data   is
confirmed   by   the distribution  of the number of objects, classified
by each of the observers, presented in Table 3 and also by the approxi-
mate constancy  of  the  AGN number revealed in each of lists (9-11%).
     Only having in mind the afore-mentioned selection effects one  can
use  the  data  of Markarian objects for various statistical investiga-
tions.

6. THE CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION

     Markarian galaxy Catalogue contains initial  data   of   all   the
objects: precise coordinates, angular sizes, and spectral types.

     Observational results of slit spectra,  UBV-   and   IR-photometry
IRAS  results,   morphological  types  and  some  other  data  are also
included into the Catalogue.  While compiling the Catalogue we  reexam-
ined   the  object lists,  excluded  false  repetitions,  rough  errors
etc., and included additional objects. These ones were  well-known ear-
lier  and, therefore, not marked in the lists,  but  detected  indepen-
dently by us on the plates and agreed with all selection criteria.

     Below we  describe  in  detail  the  parameters  of   FBS   object
Catalogue presented in Table 7.

1 - name of galaxies

2, 3 - coordinates (1950.0)

     Since all Markarian  galaxies  were   observed   with   radiotele-
scopes,  their  precise  coordinates  were measured by some authors. We
present them in the Catalogue:

     Lists         Objects        Sources

    I   - V        1 -  507   Peterson, 1973
    VI  - VII    508 -  700   Kojoian et al., 1978
    VIII         701 -  797   Foltz et al., 1980
    IX  - XI     798 - 1095   Kojoian et al., 1981a
    XII - XIV   1096 - 1399   Kojoian et al., 1981b
    XV          1400 - 1500   Kojoian et al., 1984

4 - redshifts

     The redshifts corrected  for  the  Galaxy  rotation   are   given,
the  rotation  constant  is  Q=300 km/s, (there are other values in the
literature, but all of them are reduced to one system).

5 - apparent magnitudes

     Apparent magnitudes are taken from the  CGCG   (Zwicky   et   al.,
1961 - 1968).   For   convenience, in  controlling  the data we did not
introduce corrections  to  apparent  magnitudes  for   reduction   into
other   systems.  When there were no values in CGCG, the original esti-
mates of the authors were presented. In the column 5 these  values  are
marked with asterisks.

6 - absolute magnitudes

     In order to  calculate  the  absolute  magnitudes  M  (the   value
H=75km/s/Mpc   is  taken everywhere) a correction for absorption in the
Galaxy   m  =0.24 csc (b) is introduced.

          M  = 5   (z  ) + 43.0 -   m - m

7 - angular size

     The sizes in angular seconds are measured  on  red   POSS   charts
and taken from the lists of UV-galaxies.

8 - spectral classification

     The spectral type is given according to the  lists   of   galaxies
with  UV-continuum,  in  some cases it is corrected when we had the new
plates of better quality.

9 - redshift sources

     Since for many galaxies there are several determinations  of  red-
shift,  we  present  the  single reference for our value. As a rule, we
give the most exact value. Note, that  in  our  publication  series  of
spectral observation  with  the 6-m telescope (Markarian et al., 1980a,
b; 1983a; 1984a), the corrections for the Galaxy rotation  were  calcu-
lated  in  a wrong way.  But the Catalogue gives the right values.

10 - name of galaxies

     The asterisk indicates the double objects having the same   number
in the  original  lists;  there  is  a  more detailed information about
the second component in the Comments to Table 7.

11 - morphology

     Morphological description, taken  from  the  literature,   (Hubble
or  Vaucouleurs  classification)  is presented, as a rule, for near and
bright galaxies according to Huchra  (1977),  de  Vaucouleurs  et   al.
(1976),  Nilson    (1973),   Mazarella  and  Balzano  (1987).  In  some
cases  the description "dbl" is used for close binaries.

12 - spectrum type

 Sy1-Sy2 - Sy galaxy of the corresponding type;
    Sy3  - LINER;
    QSO  - quasar;
    BL   - lacertides;
    SB   - star-burst galaxies;
    HII  - extragalactic HII region;
    e    - emission spectrum galaxy;
    a    - absorption spectrum galaxy.

     The two last notations have  been   used   when   there   was   no
necessary information about their spectra.

13 - diaphragm size

     The diaphragm size  is  given  in  arcseconds.  When   there   are
several diaphragms we present the largest one.

14-16 - UBV-photometry

     If there  are  several  data  we  give  the  most   exact   value.
The variability is noticed in remarques.

17 - UBV-photometry sources

     The photometry reference is  given  for  objects,   presented   in
the Catalogue.

18 - variability

     The symbol "v" indicates the optical variability.

19-22 - IRAS-flux at 12, 25, 60 and 100 mk


7. CONCLUSION

     The Catalogue contains 1515 records corresponding to 1512 objects,
as   3  of  them  were  included by mistake twice. The 15 galaxies, not
included in the lists according  to  reasons   mentioned   above,   are
added  into  the Catalogue. The added objects are presented in Table 5.

     While compiling the Catalogue, 40 objects were  deleted;  11   out
of  them  are  projections:  galaxy+star,  29 objects are stars (mainly
white dwarfs and subdwarfs). The list of deleted   objects   is   given
in Table 6.

     So, the available sample  of  Markarian  galaxies  contains   1469
objects.     The    distribution   of   these   objects   according  to
their classification types and spectral types is the following:

     Table 8 presents other names  of   Markarian   galaxies   included
into  various   catalogues   and   lists. For convenience of search for
Markarian galaxies according to other names the Table 9  presents   the
finding list of common names,  some references for the seldom-met names
being omitted. Below we give the list of object names.  The list of ob-
jects according to Markarian numbers are given in Table 10.
