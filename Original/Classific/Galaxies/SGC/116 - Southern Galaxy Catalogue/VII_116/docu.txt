                                   Abstract

   The "Southern Galaxy Catalogue" provides a finding list of galaxies
    larger than about 1.5 to 2 arc minutes, south of declination -17
    degrees. It includes, as far as possible, precise positions,
    morphological types, luminosity classifications, and diameters. It is
    essentially complete for log D>1.52.

    1.1 - Introduction

    The "Southern Galaxy Catalogue" (SGC) is intended to provide a finding
    list of galaxies larger than about 1.5 to 2 arc minutes, south of
    declination -17 degrees. It also provides, as far as possible, 1)
    precise positions, 2) morphological types in the revised Hubble system
    (de Vaucouleurs 1959, 1963; de Vaucouleurs, de Vaucouleurs, & Corwin,
    1976, hereafter RC2), 3) luminosity classifications in the DDO system
    (van den Bergh 1960a,b, 1966), and 4) diameters and axis ratios. The
    catalogue is essentially complete for log D>1.52 (D> 3.03'), and the
    50% completeness level is at log D = 1.42 (D = 2.06').  Only a few
    objects smaller than one arc minute are included.  Since the catalogue
    diameters refer to an isophote of about 27.5 blue magnitudes per square
    arc second (B-mss), the equivalent 50% completeness level at the 25.0
    B-mss isophote is D25 about 1.05'.  The two largest galaxies, the Large
    and Small Magellanic Clouds, are not included.

    The notes to the catalogue contain information on the appearance of the
    galaxy and on the surrounding field.  Ring diameters were measured in
    all galaxies where the rings could be seen clearly. The diameters of
    lenses were also measured in many lenticulars.  The ring diameters
    refer, as usual, to the ridge line of the brightness distribution, not
    to the outer edges of the ring structures.  Distances between
    components of the interacting galaxies are usually given, as are
    distances to noteworthy companion galaxies and, sometimes, to
    superposed or nearby stars. (Unless noted otherwise, all mea- surements
    in the notes are in arc minutes.)

    2.1 - File Structure

    The machine version of the "Southern Galaxy Catalogue" consists of two
    files. Table 1 gives their machine-independent attributes.  The
    information contained in this table is sufficient to describe the
    indigenous characteristics of the machine-readable version of the
    Southern Galaxy Catalogue to a computer. A copy of this document should
    accompany any additional transmission of these files.

    3 - Additional Information

    3.1 - Abbreviations Used in the Format Table

    1) T, n(T), and w(T) - Weighted mean numerical type T (the stage along
    the revised Hubble sequence on the RC3 scale), the number of type
    estimates for the galaxy, and the sum of the internal weights for the
    type.  If the Hubble stage is marked uncertain, that estimate was
    assigned a weight of 0.5; if marked questionable, a weight of 0.25 was
    assigned. No T is given if no Hubble stage was estimated (e.g., "S pec"
    or "Pec") or if the galaxy was classified as an I0, i.e.  a
    non-magellanic irregular (also called "Irr II" by Holmberg [1958, Medd.
    Lunds Astron. Obs.  II, No.  136] or "amorphous" by Sandage and Brucato
    1979 [AJ 84, 472]).

    2) L, n(L), and w(L) - Weighted mean numerical luminosity class L, the
    number of L estimates, and the sum of the internal weights for the
    luminosity class. Weights are assigned in the same manner as for the
    types.

    3) log D - Weighted mean logarithm of the outer diameter D along the
    major axis (in units of 0.1 arcmin as in RC3), after reduction to a
    constant epoch via the equation

                     log D = log Do + 0.5(gamma - 0.65)^2

    where gamma is the normalized fraction of time elapsed between the
    beginning of the survey (June 1976) and its end (May 1982).  The
    diameter and axis ratio are enclosed in parentheses if the measurement
    refers to more than one galaxy.

    4) log R - Weighted mean logarithm of the axis ratio R = D/d, where d
    is the diameter along the minor axis.  No correction was made to the
    axis ratios as there is no statistically significant evidence for a
    time-dependent term similar to that in the diameters.

    5) w(D), w(R), and n(D,R) - The sum of the internal weights for the
    diameter and the axis ratio. These weights were assigned as for the
    types, except that the standard uncertainty symbols were occasionally
    doubled for very doubtful measurements (near bright stars, near the
    plate edge, etc.). Thus, the lowest possible diameter (or axis ratio)
    weight is 0.13 (w = 1/8). If either the major or minor axis was marked
    uncertain or questionable, the axis ratio was assigned lower weight. 
    Otherwise, the weights for the axis ratios were the same as for the
    diameters.  n(D,R) is the number of independent diameter and axis ratio
    measurements made on different plates.

    F284                "Blank" region at 20h 11.6m -45 30 noted in
                        ESO/Uppsala survey (EU284-?34) has many F
                        galaxies and one or two very distant clusters
                        Intergalactic obscuration therefore unlikely.

    F322                Most of the galaxies here are in the two Centaurus
                        Clusters.

    F358                Fornax Cluster field A few NGC identifications here
                        are new, based on J Schmidt's observations reported
                        in A.N. 88, 138, 1876 The survey is to a slightly
                        deeper limit in this field to pick up some of the
                        Fornax Cluster dwarves A few of the brighter
                        ellipticals and lenticulars appear to have "knots"
                        superposed on their lens and coronae; these may be
                        globular clusters, but as the field is rich in
                        distant galaxies and clusters, they are more likely
                        to be background galaxies.

                        cloud Stars are superposed on all galaxies here.

    Plate,Field         Notes

    J0041,F288          Slightly trailed,  slightly underexposed.  The
                        field was resurveyed on J1633.

    J0367,F432          Underexposed plate. Field resurveyed, J4901.

    J0563,F325          Slightly out of focus

    J0620,F386          A poorer than usual plate. Field resurveyed, J2989.

    J0718,F527          Plate slightly trailed.

    J0817,F532          Double images. Field resurveyed, J3420

    J0928,F078          A large plate defect obscures N7733 and N7734; it
                        was impossible to measure their diameters on this
                        plate. Field resurveyed, J3750.

    J0929,F079          Fuzzy images Field resurveyed, J1864.

    J1004,F080          Plate centered at 0129 5-6525. Nominal center
                        0128-65. Field resurveyed, J1748.

    J1050,F357          About 1/3 of this plate is obscured by a large,
                        dark defect In addition, the images are quite poor.
                        Field resurveyed, J2770.

    J1127,F155          Poor images on this plate. Field resurveyed, J1826.

    J1164,F059          Fuzzy images. Field resurveyed, J2009.

    J1313,F270          Background uneven (film only?): processing fault?

    J1436,F434          Exposure only ten minutes.  No diameters measured
                        on this plate. Field resurveyed, J4740.

    J1477,F322          Very good images, but slightly underexposed?

    J1585,F141          This plate is underexposed, taken in bad seeing,
                        and was misguided. Its proper grade is "D," not
                        "A" as given on the observing card. Field
                        resurveyed, J1580.

    J2668,F302          Images are a bit fuzzy for an "A" grade plate.

    J2945,F006          "C" grade plate with "B" grade images and a few
                        faint light streaks

    J2989,F386          slightly fuzzy images (film only?)

    J3648,F001          Slightly trailed. Field resurveyed, J3665.
