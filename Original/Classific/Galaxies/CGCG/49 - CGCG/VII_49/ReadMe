Foreword:
    All this documentation file is derived from the
    "Documentation for the Machine-Readable Version of the Catalogue of
    Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies: Data on Individual Galaxies"
    prepared by Robert S. Hill, NASA Doc. SSD-T-1-5069-0022-82
    (November 1982)

Description:
    This document describes a machine-readable version of a portion of the
    "Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies" (Zwicky, et al.). The
    published catalogue covers 560 Palomar Sky Survey fields, and for each
    field it lists both individual galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Its
    limiting magnitude for galaxies is approximately +15.5 apparent
    photographic magnitude. The present machine-readable version includes
    only the individual galaxies. It consists of two files, the first of
    which lists the galaxies (data file) and the second of which
    enumerates the fields covered (headers file). Note: the abbreviation
    ADC used in this document refers to the Astronomical Data Center,
    NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.

Note (1): not all the fields surveyed are represented in this file, as
    some contain clusters only. The fields coincide with a subset of
    Palomar Sky Survey fields but are numbered differently. The records in
    this file are sorted in the same order as the corresponding data in
    the published catalogue: by field number (ascending), and within each
    field by right ascension (ascending).
Note (2): The introduction to vol. 1 of the published catalogue contains
    detailed descriptions of the methods of estimation, which can be
    summarized as follows: magnitudes down to about 15.2 or 15.5 were
    estimated using the Schraffier method on films taken with an 18-inch
    Schmidt camera; below this magnitude range, estimates were made
    directly from the 48-inch Schmidt plates. The nominal limiting
    magnitude of the catalogue is +15.7, but fainter objects may be
    present.
Note (3): Remarks include notations such as "diffuse" or "compact."
    Numerical data, such as velocities or Harvard magnitudes, are not
    taken to be remarks.

Note (1): All the published fields are represented in this file, with
    one record per field, even if the field contains no individual
    galaxies.
    The field center may be displaced from the corresponding Palomar Sky
    Survey plate center by as much as half a degree, but the entire field
    is always contained within the corresponding Palomar Sky Survey plate
    area. The fields are six by six degrees.
Note (2): This information was generated by computer and is not in the
    published catalogue. The following fields contain no individual
    galaxies (headers are, however, present in this file):
    443 444 489 490 509 510 511 527 528 543
Note (3): This information was derived independently of the published
    catalogue by comparison with a Fortran program of center coordinates
    to a PSS headers file (see Catalogue: VI/25)
Note (4): This system numbers the PSS fields (including Whiteoak
    extension) from 1 ... 1037. The numbers equal the corresponding
    Luyten- Palomar (LP) numbers plus 1, except for the north polar
    fields, which in the LP system are numbered 1A and 1B; and in the
    MLP system, 1 and 2. The LP system comes from the Luyten- Palomar
    automated proper motion survey. The MLP numbers are used in
    PSS-oriented catalogues developed by the ADC.

Historical Notes:
  * November 1982, by Robert S. Hill (Doc. SSD-T-1-5069-0022-82)
    This version is based on one supplied to the ADC by M. Hauser
    (NASA/GSFC), which consists of six files of card images corresponding
    to the six volumes of the published catalogue. For each survey field,
    there is a header record and a trailer record, and the data for the
    galaxies are in the intervening records, with four galaxies per
    record. According to Hauser (private communication), this version may
    have been keypunched at the California Institute of Technology in the
    early 1970's.

    The present version was generated by the following steps:
     (1)   the information for each galaxy was written to a separate
           record, to which the field number was added;
     (2)   the header and trailer records were deleted, and the headers
           were written to a separate file;
     (3)   using a Fortran program, the headers were compared to data on
           the Palomar Sky Survey fields, and the PSS and MLP numbers
           were added as appropriate;
     (4)   the galaxy counts for each field were generated and added to
           the headers.

    In addition, the following errors were corrected:
     (1)   thirteen galaxies dropped from field 30 were restored;
     (2)   the errata published in vols. 2-6 were incorporated as far as
           they were relevant, as follows:
             Field No.          Correction
               13        Galaxy 1156.7-0323 became 1158.7-0323.
               39        Galaxy 1118.6+0328 added.
               41        Galaxy 1212.7+0602 added.
               42        Galaxy 1221.1+0720 got remarks flag.
               42        Galaxy 1221.2+0728 became 1221.3+0728.
               42        Galaxy 1221.5+0719 became 1221.6+0719.
               70        Galaxy 1223.7+1314 Lost remarks flag.
               70        Galaxy 1223.9+0917 got remarks flag.
               70        Galaxy 1228.0+1246 added.
              126        Galaxy 1110.8+2226 added.
              153        Pmag of galaxy 956.4+3059 became 13.6.
              267        Galaxy 1100.0+5629 became 1100.2+5629.
              431        Pmag of galaxy 2326.0+1427 became 13.2.

    Not all the data on individual galaxies in the original published
    catalogue are in this version. In particular, there are no IC or NGC
    numbers, velocities, or data from other catalogues. Also,
    supplementary data on particular galaxies within the clusters are not
    included.
