Description:
    The Catalog of bright diffuse Galactic nebulae was compiled in the
    frame of a thesis investigating the spatial distribution and the
    geometrical properties of bright diffuse Galactic nebulae, together
    with some inquiries into the interstellar absorption problem. It is a
    mostly complete compilation of the knowledge about bright galactic
    nebulae around 1945.

    Global parameters derived for each nebula include a classification,
    the apparent dimensions, and distance estimations; the Catalog
    includes also extensive notes, and its bibliography covers the period
    1877 to 1941.

Note on refs.dat:
    As far as possible the author has consulted the books and papers
    listed in the Bibliography. When direct checks have not been possible
    it has been deemed necessary to ensure completion by means of
    available second hand sources. In some few cases an exact title has
    not been accessible; a brief reference to the topic in question has
    then been given within brackets. The abbreviations used have mainly
    been chosen in accordance with those employed in the Astronomischer
    Jahresbericht. The periodical publication "Knowledge" is not
    accessible within Sweden, with the exception of some few Separate
    numbers. It is thus to be feared that articles relevant in the present
    connection (e.g. by Barnard, Ranyard, and Roberts) have
    unintentionally been omitted by the author. As a rule, comprehending
    reviews of a purely popular kind have been excluded. The references
    concerning adjoining branches of Astronomy (dark nebulae, novae, open
    clusters, planetaries) have been restricted to a necessary minimum.

Note (1): Hubble's law expresses the relation between
    the brightness (m) of a star illuminating the nebula and its
    maximal distance (a1) to the nebular boundary, as:
        m + 5 log(a1) = B
    where B is a constant equal to 11.61 if a1 is expressed in arcmin,
    assuming isotropic light reflection and zero absorption.

Note (2): Spectrum of the nebula:
    E = emission established by observation
    e = emission inferred from the spectral type of the exciting star
    C = continuous spectrum established by observations
    c = continuous spectrum inferred from the spectral type of the
        illuminating star

Note (3): Classification of Bright Diffuse Nebulae:
    A: Nebulous clusters.
       1: Milky nebulosity covering the clusters. (Ex. NGC 1976)
       2: Patches of nebulosity adhering to individual stars
          of the cluster. (Ex. The Pleiades)
       3: Cluster with nebulous envelop of intricate structure.
          (Ex. NGC 2175)
    B: Nebulae associated with mainly one star (which may be multiple)
       1: Star surrounded by a nebulous envelope without conspicuous
          structure. (Ex. {lambda} Scorpii)
       2: Star surrounded by a nebulous envelope with conspicuous
          structure. (Ex. IC 5146)
       3: Fan-shaped object. (Ex. IC 59)
       4: Nebula with bright rim. (Ex. IC 434)
       5: Large nebulous region illuminated by a star outside its border.
          (Ex. NGC 7000)
       6: Quasi-planetary, representing a transitional type between
          real planetaries and bright diffuse nebulae. (Ex. NGC 1514)
    C: Nebulae without definite relation to certain stars.
       1: Detached nebula with discernible structure. (Ex. NGC 6992)
       2: Background veil of a nebulous region. (Ex. The Taurus veil)

Note (4): Methods are marked as follows:
    a = spectral parallaxes of associated stars
  b,c = parallaxes from proper motions of associated stars
    d = differential secular parallaxes according to the method devised
        by J.C. Kapteyn
  e,f = parallaxes based on star counts
    g = dynamical parallaxes of associated stars
    h = trigonometric parallaxes of associated stars
    i = minimum parallaxes from foreground stars
    j = parallaxes from reflection of starlight against dark matter in the
        case of nebulae associated with novae and variable stars
    k = parallaxes from internal motions of the nebulae
    l = parallaxes from the effect of differential galactic rotation on
        stellar velocities and interstellar line displacements
    m = parallaxes from intensities of interstellar lines
    n = parallaxes of open clusters involved in nebulae

Note (5): the galactic coordinates refer to the old system, several
    degrees away from the modern galactic frame.

Note (1): The remarks to the catalogue are self-explanatory.
     The catalogue acronyms used are:
    GC = John Herschel's and Dreyer's General Catalogue of nebulae and
         clusters (Compare ante p 24)., 1888MmRAS..49....1D
         (NGC Catalog, see <VII/1>)
     H = William Herschel.
     h = John Herschel.
         The designations H, or h, followed by a number, refer to William and
         John Herschel's successive catalogues of nebulae and clusters.
         (Compare Chapter I:2).
     M = Messier, 1850CDT..1784..227M
    HD = the Henry Draper catalogue, Cat. <III/135>
  Boss = General Catalogue of 33342 stars for the epoch 1950 by
         Benjamin Boss, Cat. <I/113>

    In this file have been collected some data and additional references
    extracted from the card catalogue of bright diffuse galactic nebulae
    which has been brought together by the author. The current numbers
    refer to the catalogue entries of the present paper.

    The content of the bibliographical notes may be summarized as follows:

 1. Synonyms of the objects.

 2. When known, the name of the discoverer and the year of discovery have
    been given together with a reference to the source of this data. If
    the discoverer is not known for certain, the word "source" has been
    used in combination with a reference to the earliest known paper where
    the object in question is mentioned. If a series of synonyms is
    followed by a year of discovery, the discoverer is the last one in the
    series. Thus, "NGC 3199 = GC 2067 = h3239. Disc.1835", means that the
    nebula was discovered by John Herschel in 1835.

 3. Each nebula has been supplied with references to those papers in the
    bibliography where it has been treated. Here, some restrictions have
    been introduced with regard to completeness. Thus, a selection has
    been deemed necessary with regard to published photographical
    reproductions of galactic nebulae. Further, the author has not aimed
    at completeness concerning all papers were a certain nebula has only
    been mentioned without further information of interest.

    References to papers in Holden's bibliography have not been included,
    as Holden has given no current enumeration. An explicit quotation of
    these papers - which afford for the most part a historical interest
    only - would have unduly augmented the present section.
    Besides, references to earlier publications are to be found in the NGC
    and in some of the papers of the bibliography, e.g. in (114) and
    (119). No (481) in the bibliography (Lundmark's manuscript) contains
    (mostly stellar) data for the following nebulae in the catalogue: No:
    3, 4, 7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20 , 22, 25, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37,
    38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 46, 49, 52, 54, 55, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69,
    74, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 83, 84, 89, 90, 94, 96, 109, 123, 125, 129,
    130, 131, 132, 133, 139, 151, 152, 154, 157, 161, 163, 165, 176, 179,
    183, 186, 187, 194, 195, 196, 198, 209, 210, 211.

Note on Ref:
  * Herassimovitch (343) is identical with Gerasimovic (272).
    William Huggins' papers are also to be found in "The scientific
    papers" of Sir William Huggins, London 1909.

  * For (119) the year of publication is not known to the author. The
    paper is reviewed in the AJB of 1919. It has, however, very likely
    been printed several years earlier as the name of Peiresc is not
    mentioned in connection with the discovery of the Orion nebula.

  * (574) refers to articles on galactic nebulae by Ranyard. The exact
    titles are not known to the author.
