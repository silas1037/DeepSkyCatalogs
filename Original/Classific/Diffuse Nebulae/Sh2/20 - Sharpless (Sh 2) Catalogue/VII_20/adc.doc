                          SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION



In recent years there has been a trend away from publishing catalogues in book
form to preparing catalogues by computer and distributing them on magnetic
tape, with appearance in book form a secondary occurrence.  This memo is the
result of the development of the documentation for the machine-readable
version of the catalogue and includes the basic information given in the
original preface of the published catalogue.  This memo should be distributed
along with any copy of the machine-readable version of the catalogue.

A byte-by-byte description of the contents of the catalogue is given in Table
2-1.  The information in the "Description" column is derived mainly from the
published version of the catalogue whenever possible.  The "Suggested Format"
column is for FORTRAN-formatted reads.

         puted from the computed (precessed) equatorial
         coordinates (1950.0).  This quantity is not in
         the original publication.  The difference be-
         tween these "new" galactic coordinates and those
         in the published catalogue is not a constant value
         for all entries.

         computed from the given equatorial coordinates
         (1900.0) in the published catalogue.  This quantity
         is not in the published catalogue.

                    SECTION 4 - REMARKS AND MODIFICATIONS



The machine-readable version of the Sharpless Catalogue of H II Regions was
received from the University of Maryland.  This catalogue was published in 1959
in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (number 41, pages 257- 280).
The original card deck was in the 026 punch and this was converted to a 029
deck.  Many of the quantities in this version of the catalogue were not in the
published catalogue.  The epochs of the precessed equatorial coordinates were
determined empirically from the data as given on the computer cards.  All of
the quantities which do not appear in the published version of the catalogue
have been identified in Table 2-1.
