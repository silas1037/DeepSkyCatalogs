Description:
    A  survey of the Milky Way southward of the Palomar Sky Survey for the
    identification of reflection nebulae was  carried  out  at  the  Cerro
    Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.  Plates in blue light were
    obtained at  the Curtis Schmidt telescope covering  a strip of plus or
    minus  six degrees of the galactic  equator.  Red sensitive plates for
    comparison were  also obtained  with the  same telescope  covering the
    same area near the galactic plane.  Observatory staff members and some
    students of the University of Toronto,  Canada assisted in identifying
    stars embedded  in nebulosity as  shown by the  plates.  Although this
    catalogue  roughly complements the Catalogue  of Reflection Nebulae of
    van  den Berg (1966AJ.....71..990V,  Cat.  <VII/21>),  the region here
    surveyed is more narrowly confined to the galactic equator.

Note to the electronic version: (by Raymond Bruton, pam99999@swbell.net
    and Patrick Chevalley, pch@crosswinds.net):

    The intended purpose of the electronic version of the BHe catalogue is
    for use with the computer plotting of star charts. Astronomical
    software, (Cartes du Ciel-Sky Charts) developed by the second editor
    (Patrick Chevalley) was used to test dataset validity (see
    http://www.astrosurf.org/astropc). Any errors in the dataset should be
    reported to the editors. Any gross error in the original should
    likewise be reported. As a check on errors the work of Herbst
    (1975AJ.....80..212H) was consulted. When used with the northern
    dataset of van den Berg (1966AJ.....71..990V, see Cat. <VII/21>) the
    work of Racine (1968AJ.....73..233R) was likewise consulted as a check
    for possible errors and misidentifications.

    The indiscriminate comparison of the present work with the work of
    van den Berg (1966AJ.....71..990V) is not recommended. When using the
    northern and southern datasets for reflection nebulae together for
    plots of surface distribution the differences are clearly evident.
    This was also indicated in the original publication of van den Berg
    and Herbst (1975AJ.....80..212H). For plots of the southern nebulae
    further from the galactic plane than the present work a remedy was
    sought and in part found. The catalogue of southern dark clouds of
    Hartley et al. (1986A&AS...63...27HC, see Cat. <VII/191>) was used
    because of prolific notes about association with bright nebulae.
    Although this combination was useful the editors also used the
    catalogue of Herbig and Bell (1988, see Cat. <V/73A> for cross checks
    on position errors. The editors were motivated to produce the present
    dataset in part due to the popularization of some BHe objects by
    Slotegraaf (1998). Mr. Slotegraaf also encouraged the production of
    the present dataset in private correspondence. This work would not
    have been possible without the use of the NASA Astrophysics Data
    System maintained at Harvard College, USA., for the obtaining of the
    original paper of van den Berg and Herbst (1975AJ.....80..212H), and
    closely related papers. The American Astronomical Society, and the
    University Press, Chicago, USA, are thanked for making copyrighted
    papers from the Astronomical Journal available to the NASA
    Astrophysics Data System and indirectly to the editors.
