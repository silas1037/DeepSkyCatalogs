8,"Center of a dark, irregular lane about 2.6 degrees long and 22' + or -"

9,"Dark, irregular vacancy. This is the middle of a great vacancy extending"
9,"east and west, the continuous part of which is 2.5 degrees long and about"
9,.5 degree wide. It really extends in a more or less broken form for about
9,6 degrees. There is a wide region extending south of it for a couple of
9,"degrees, nearly to the star BD +53 750 (magnitude 5.0) whose position is"
9,"4h6m58s, N 53 18' (1875.0). To the east it breaks up into more or less"
9,"separate spots, somewhat resembling those at the east end of the great"
9,"lane from Rho Ophiuchi, but unlike that lane it does not originate in a"
9,larger vacant space or a nebula. Its borders are not so definite as the
9,"Rho Ophiuchi lane. It is approximately bounded by the coordinates 3h58m,"
9,"N54.7 and 4h20m, N54.8. The individual positions of some of the spots are"
9,given in the catalogue.

14,"(Position given in Astrophysical Journal, 49, 14, (1919ApJ....49....1B) in"
14,error by 10m in right ascension.)
15,Elliptical; diameter 15' x 10' slightly NW and SE. One of the finest
15,examples of a dark object seen against the ordinary sky and away from the
15,Milky Way. The background on which the stars shine is uniform over the
15,"entire plate. The object is in a region somewhat larger than itself, where"
15,"there are relatively few stars, and is black by contrast with the sky"
15,alone. It clearly shows the presence of a feeble uniform luminosity in
15,"space which, from the appearance of similar objects in widely different"
15,"parts of the sky, leads to the belief that this feeble illumination of"
15,distant space is universal. If this object were seen against the star
15,clouds of the Milky Way it would appear strikingly black.

20,"In S part of larger, relatively vacant area; this is the dark object"
20,"mentioned by Espin in Monthly Notices, 58, 334, (1898MNRAS..58..334E). It"
20,is close north of a small group of faint stars and is 6' or 8' in
20,diameter. In a somewhat larger vacant space (sic). It is not so definite
20,as B 15.
21,Indefinite; irregularly round
22,Irregular; unequally dark; extended SE and NW; this is a very large region
22,of obscure nebulosity with several darker streaks in it trending
22,northwest. It is partly separated from another starless region lying about
22,2 degrees to the west and north. Near the middle of the first of these
22,regions is a small luminous nebula with a faint fan-shaped extension for
22,10' to the northeast (B 14). This is undoubtedly a brighter condensation
22,of the great obscuring mass surrounding it. The position of this small
22,"nebula is 4h32m20s, N25 30' (1875.0)."
23,Sharply pointed to the SE; BD +29 728 (magnitude 6.5) in N part

25,region

30,"wide, to the semi-vacant region extending 1 degree east and north from BD"
30,+12 803 (magnitude 7.0). Apparently this nebulous border extends many
30,degrees east in a very diffused manner. There is a narrow dark lane
30,"extending south from the semi-vacant region, running close west of BD +12"
30,803 to a point nearly 1 degree south of BD +12 801 (mag 6.9). There is a
30,small fan-shaped nebula close north of a small star in the position
30,"5h24m30s, +12 3.9' (1875.0). A small strip of nebulosity extends 5'"
30,southwest from this star. These two nebulae are probably the brighter
30,parts of a large obscure nebulosity.

32,Dark projection from S. end of B 31 to the E.

37,"Irregular, semi-vacant region. This region is abruptly terminated on the S"
37,side by the nebulosity extending north from 15 Monocerotis. Its west side
37,"ends abruptly at 6h22m15s, +12 26' (1875.0). B 37, 38, and 39 are shown in"
37,"Plates 28 and 29, Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 1913."
38,Irregular vacancy. This seems to refer to a portion of B 37.
39,"Small, sharply defined, elongated spot in the nebulosity NW of 15"
39,Monocerotis
40,Diffused dark spot; small star in it. This spot and B 41 are connected
40,with the great nebula about Nu Scorpii and are doubtless denser opaque
40,masses of the nebula. There is a larger dark region belonging to this same
40,"system in 16h23m, -19 30' (1875.0) (B 43), from which broken dark lanes"
40,"somewhat like those from Rho Ophiuchi, though less marked, run eastward"
40,for some degrees.
41,Diffused dark spot
42,"Great nebula of Mu Ophiuchi; this object is put in the list because,"
42,"though not wholly dark, it is partly so, and the evident obscuration"
42,produced by it puts it in the class for which the catalogue is made. The
42,"semi-vacant region in which this, the great nebula of Rho Ophiuchi, lies"
42,is about 3.5 degrees in diameter. For references to the visual discovery
42,and early observations of this strange region see Astronomische
42,"Nachrichten, 138, 211, 1895; Popular Astronomy 5, 227, 1897; 14, 581,"
42,"1906; Lick Observatory Publications, 11, 19, 1913 and Plate 36."
43,Large dark region
44,Dark lane E. from Rho Ophiuchi region. This is the middle of the main part
44,of the great vacant lane that runs east from the region of Rho Ophiuchi.
44,It is about 32' wide and has its beginning in a vacant area in which is
44,"the star 22 Scorpii (CD -24 12695, magnitude 5.5). It runs slightly"
44,"northeast to about 16h40m, -23 40' (1875.0). From this point it extends in"
44,a broken chain of dark spots to a little south of B 63. Its total length
44,is therefore about 10 degrees.
44a,Irregular; sharpest on SE side; CD -40 10662 (mag 9.0) close N. Apparently
44a,"a real, dark object."

45,object.

47,Irregular; definite; connected with B 51 by two sharp lanes

50,"Large, irregular dark space; this is an irregular square, sharply defined"
50,"on the east side and diffused on the west, where there are broken"
50,extensions for 30'. The star CD -34 11418 (magnitude 9.8) is near the
50,middle. The stars CD -34 11422 (magnitude 9.8) and -34 11427 (magnitude
50,9.9) are on the eastern border.
51,Definite; one of a straggling group toward the eastern end of the dark

55,Irregular; best defined SE.; CD -31 13582 (magnitude 8.9) near the center

58,Slightly extended N and S; a darker core at NE side
59,Sink hole; at the W end of a wide broken lane from B 78
60,Curved; extended NE and SW; this and B 57 are the most distinct of a group
60,of dark spots SW of the square end of B 63.
61,Small; elongated E and W

63,"Large, definite, curved figure, convex to N; the W end abrupt; 97' E and"
63,"W, 19' wide"
64,Cometary; W of M 9; This object is somewhat cometary in form and has a
64,very black core or head that sharply abuts against the thick stratum of
64,stars; from this it spreads out into a large dark area with much dark
64,"detail, filling quite a space close southwest of M 9. It thus resembles a"
64,dark comet with a dense and well-defined head and diffused widening tail.
64,"The position of the head is 17h9m57s, -18 20.6 (1875.0)."
