Description:
    The catalog is a modern, revised, and expanded version of the original
    NGC (Dreyer 1888). In addition to incorporating the many corrections
    to the NGC found over the years, each object was verified on Palomar
    Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) prints and on plates for southern
    objects specifically taken for the purpose (although about 90 southern
    objects could not be verified).

    Please refer to the documentation by Wayne H. Warren Jr. in
    file "adc.doc".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note (1): the object type is coded as follows :
    1 Open Cluster                    6 Cluster associated with nebulosity
    2 Globular Cluster                7 Non existent
    3 Diffuse Nebula                  8 Object in Large Magellanic Cloud
    4 Planetary Nebula                9 Object in Small Magellanic Cloud
    5 Galaxy                          0 Unverified southern object
  Combination of two type numbers may appear for an object
  (such as 28 for a Globular cluster in LMC, etc)
Note (2): The magnitude sources are coded as follows:
    1 de Vaucouleurs (RC1, 1964)      5  Collinder (1931)
    2 Zwicky (1961-1968)   <VII/49>   6  Arp (1965)          <VII/13>
    3 Vorontsov-Velyaminov <VII/62>   7  Vorontsov-Velyaminov (1931)
    4 Lindsay  =1958MNRAS.118..172L   8  Bok (1962), Van den Bergh (1968)
  The complete references are given in the file "adc.doc".
Note (3): data blocks, separated by commas, each describing an aspect
  of the visual appearance of the object from Dreyer's (1888) catalogue.
    The appearance aspects are written in the following order:
    (a) For nebulae the sequence of blocks is:
        brightness, size, shape, radial brightness variation,
        comments referring to the field.
    (b) For clusters the sequence is:
        identification (cluster), size, richness, compression,
        brightness of the stars therein.
    The various codes and abbreviations are detailed in Table 5 of
    the file "adc.doc".
Note (4): The data blocks in the new description do not follow the
    regular sequence used in the old description.
    The description are decoded by taking each individual block of
    comma-separated data and finding the largest combination of
    letters present in the RNGC code table (Table 6 in file "adc.doc").
Note (5): See Table 7 in file "adc.doc" for acronyms used in
    cross-references.
Note (6): Some anonymous objects near NGC objects or components
    in multiple systems are assigned the same NGC number followed
    by a letter in alphabetic sequence

Historical Notes:
  * See Section 4 in file "adc.doc"
  * The catalogue was distributed on the "Selected Astronomical Catalogs"
    Vol. 1 CD-ROM (1991), directory      /nonstell/galaxies/rngc,
    as five files: the description (the present "adc.doc" file),
    the data file, old (Dreyer's) description supplement,
    new description supplement, and cross-reference supplements.
  * 15-Mar-1993: the four data files were merged into a single
    "catalog" file at CDS (Francois Ochsenbein).
  * 04-Nov-1995: this ReadMe file revisited at CDS.
  * 07-Apr-1999: catalog.dat corrected at CDS (bad Messier numbers)
  * 07-Oct-2014: catalog.dat corrected at CDS (first letter of oldDesc was 
    mistakenly repeated (FF instead of F, VVF instead of VF, NNEBULA etc, PO)
