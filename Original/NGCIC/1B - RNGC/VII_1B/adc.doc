This document provides detailed descriptions of the contents and format of the
machine-readable version of the catalogue being distributed by the Astronomical
Data Center.  Coding for the various scales and abbreviations used in the
catalogue are tabulated and certain revisions to the machine version made to
improve storage efficiency and notation are described.

The Revised New General Catalogue of Nonstellar Astronomical Objects (RNGC)
(Sulentic and Tifft 1973) is a modern, revised and expanded version of the New
General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (Dreyer 1888).  While
incorporating the many corrections to the original edition found over the
years, the RNGC objects were verified on Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS)
prints and plates for southern objects especially taken for the purpose (about
90 southern objects could not be verified) and are tied to the POSS where
possible by the inclusion of rectangular coordinates on the prints.  New
object descriptions are provided for objects which were examined during the
course of the work, Galactic coordinates are given, and new magnitudes are
reported along with their sources.

This document describes the magnetic tape version of the RNGC, as distributed
by the Astronomical Data Center.  It is intended to enable users to read and
process the data without problems or guesswork.  For more extensive
descriptions of the data in the RNGC and an explanation of the procedures used
to develop or derive them, the published catalogue reference below should be
consulted since it contains an extensive introduction with a wealth of
valuable information.  A copy of this document should be supplied with any
machine-readable copy of the catalogue.

Byte-by-byte descriptions of the contents of the tape files of the RNGC are
given in Tables 1-4.  The suggested format specifications are for FORTRAN
formatted read statements and can be modified depending upon individual
programming and processing requirements.  Since data fields contain blanks
where data are absent, care must be exercised when processing the data for
certain purposes.  Alternate format specifications are given in parentheses.

The information contained in Table 8 is sufficient to describe the indigeneous
characteristics of the machine-readable RNGC files to a computer.  Information
easily varied from installation to installation, such as block size (physical
record length), blocking factor (number of logical records per physical
record), total number of blocks, file density, number of tracks, and internal
coding (EBCDIC, ASCII, etc.) is not included.  This information should always
be supplied if secondary copies are transmitted to other users or
installations.  Data for the four catalogue files are separated by commas.

             SECTION 4 - REMARKS, MODIFICATIONS AND REFERENCES


The Revised New General Catalogue of Nonstellar Astronomical Objects was
received a number of years ago on a BCD coded tape containing seven files.
The formats of the files corresponded very closely to the printed formats of
the seven sections of the published edition.  Although the format of the data
file was satisfactory for computer processing, the multicolumn structure of
the supplement files and the presence of titling information and blank records
made those files unsuitable for computer searching, sorting, etc.  The final
three files of precession tables are not necessary for modern computer
processing of the catalogue to other equinoxes; hence, they have been removed
from the machine-readable version.  The following modifications were made to
the first four files:

1.  All files were converted from O26 to O29 coding: the character coded files
    are thus available in EBCDIC or ASCII internal coding.  Due to the
    unavailability of certain other standard characters of astronomical
    notation to the authors of the catalogue, substitutions were made in the
    tape and printed editions.  Thus, the following conversions were made to
    the files in order to restore the correct astronomical notation:

    Tape          Published Version      Converted to


    @@            two not-equals signs   "
    @             one not-equals sign    '
    $             $                      &


The presence of parentheses to denote ? in the old (Dreyer) descriptions and a
right parenthesis to denote ? in the new (RNGC) descriptions remain unchanged.

2.  Plus (+) signs were added to all positive declinations in the data file
    (byte 19).

3.  The logical record length of the data file was changed from 120 bytes to
    116 bytes, since bytes 117-120 were never used.

4.  The two- and three-column formats of files 2-4 were changed to the
    standard structure of one object per record after titles and blank records
    were deleted.  The 120-byte logical record length files were then changed
    to their present 30-, 44-, and 30-byte lengths.
